<p>Many have said and acknowledged that Targaryens are much closer to gods than they are to men. They were demigods that conquered the land, seas, and skies with mighty dragons whose mere presence alone could make kingdoms bend the knee.</p><p>But their power would come with responsibility far too great for the mere human to understand.</p><p>Since the conquest of Aegon The Conqueror, the Targaryens have ruled the seven realms with a mighty flame that got stronger as generations breathed anew.</p><p>No power in the world could stand against House Targaryen - no one has dared to.</p><p>In fact, the only power that would stand against House Targaryen was the power that the House had from within.</p><p>The only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon...</p><p>... was itself.</p><p>The prophecy of the Song of Ice and Fire is no secret between Targaryen heirs and their predecessors. As the prophecy foretold, a terrible winter would begin and the Seven Kingdoms would be thrust into darkness. The only way for Westeros to survive is if a Targaryen was seated on the Iron Throne.</p><p>But for Queen Aemma Arryn, the prophecy that had shown itself to her was much different.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>King Viserys walked into the Queen's bath, looking at his wife with a small smile as he closed the door behind him, "you spend more time in that bath than I do on the throne."</p><p>Queen Aemma chuckled, "this is the only place I can find comfort these days."</p><p>The King took a seat beside the bathtub where the Queen sat and slowly placed his hand inside the tub to feel the water, "it's tepid."</p><p>"It's as warm as the maesters would allow, my love," Queen Aemma responded as King Viserys reached to stroke his wife's hair, "don't they know dragons prefer heat?" He asked as he took the Queen's hand in his.</p><p>"After this miserable pregnancy," Queen Aemma began, "I wouldn't be surprised if I hatched an actual dragon."</p><p>The King chuckled slightly, "then he will be loved and cherished," he responded before kissing his wife's knuckles.</p><p>"Rhaenyra has already declared that she would have a sister," The Queen stated as the King smiled in amusement, "really now?" He asked as the female nodded.</p><p>"She even named her," Queen Aemma smiled.</p><p>"Dare I ask?" Said the King with a curious tone.</p><p>"Visenya," Queen Aemma began, "she chose a dragon's egg for the cradle that reminded her most of Vhagar."</p><p>The King let out a sigh of disbelief, "gods be good," he said, "this family already has its Visenya."</p><p>There was a pause between the two of them before the Queen would ask about Prince Daemon - a question to which the King did not appreciate much as he did know much of his brother since taking command of the City Watch.</p><p>"I'm sure he will come for the tourney," King Viserys assured as Queen Aemma raised a brow, "he can never stay away from the lists," the King added.</p><p>"Ah, yes, the tourney," The Queen chuckled slightly, "the one to celebrate the firstborn son that we presently do not have."</p><p>The King was silent.</p><p>"Viserys, you do understand that nothing will cause a babe to grow a cock if they are not born with one?" Queen Aemma asked as the King sighed.</p><p>"This child is a boy, Aemma," The King firmly stated, "I've never been more certain of anything because of that dream."</p><p>The Queen looked up at his husband, "that dream is clearer than memory," King Viserys spoke as the former looked into the water.</p><p>"Our son was born wearing Aegon's iron crown," King Viserys began, "there were sounds of thundering hooves, splintering shields, and ringing swords, and I placed our son upon the Iron Throne as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled and all the dragons roared as one."</p><p>Queen Aemma looked at her husband with a small smile, "shall I tell you of a dream that I've had about a babe?"</p><p>King Viserys smiled in amusement, "a dream, you say?" He asked as his Queen nodded, "I would love to hear it."</p><p>The Queen smiled at him, "I dreamt of a large and bright moon," she began, "a large moon shining over the Iron Throne as a large dragon loomed behind it," she narrated as the King listened intently.</p><p>"Then I would see the shadow of a person wearing a crown that I have not yet seen before," Queen Aemma continued, "and when this shadow raised a sword, dragons followed."</p><p>Queen Aemma turned to face her husband, "I've seen that dream many nights and yet I still cannot see the face of the one who wears the crown."</p><p>King Viserys looked at his wife with a smile, "it seems your dream is much more powerful than mine, my love."</p><p>Queen Aemma laughed slightly before looking at Viserys with a sad expression "this is the last time, Viserys," she said.</p><p>"I've lost one babe in the cradle, two stillbirths, and two pregnancies that ended well before they came to term," The Queen sighed, "that's five in twice as many years."</p><p>The King looked at his wife longingly as the Queen continued, "I know that it is my duty to provide you with an heir and I'm sorry if I have failed you in that, I am, but I have mourned all the dead children that I can."</p><p>King Viserys was at a loss for words, instead, he held his wife's hand tighter and leaned his forehead against hers. A comfortable silence enveloped them as the King whispered words of love to his wife.</p><p>For once in many years, there was a sense of contentment.</p><p>"I would like to see your dream come to life," King Viserys spoke, "it would be as if the heavens above agree with whoever wears the crown."</p><p>Queen Aemma smiled, "I yearn to see it come to life as well."</p><p>One dreamt of a King while the other dreamt of the moon - one should rise and fall. Only time will tell which dream would indeed come to its fruition. </p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p align="center">𝐐𝐔𝐄𝐑𝐄𝐍𝐂𝐈𝐀.</p><p align="center">(n.) a place from which one's strength is drawn; where one feels at home; the place where you are your most authentic self. </p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p>

<b>LEVANA VELARYON.<br/></b>
<b>THE FIRTS AND LAST OF HER NAME, RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE IRON THRONE<br/>THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Levana Velaryon was born to Ser Laenor Velaryon and Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen - according to history, she would be their only legitimate child born just before Princess Rhaenyra's first son, Jacaerys Velaryon. </p><p>Born of the blood of Old Valyria, she had the passion of her Grandsires Lord Corlys and King Viserys, the gentle nature of Queen Aemma, and the wisdom of Princess Rhaenys. Many also compared her to Saera Targaryen and the Good Queen Alysanne. </p><p>A combination that many would consider the traits of a future Queen - the heir to the Iron Throne. </p><p>Many also considered her to be lucky as her parentage was never questioned - contrary to that of her siblings. With silver-white hair and lilac eyes, it was no mistake that she was born to the Houses Velaryon and Targaryen. While the lineage of her brothers was questioned, Levana never saw them as anything different - she frowned upon those who treated them differently from her because of what they looked like. </p><p>She would even voice her disdain for Queen Alicent who often spoke ill of her brothers and father. While Rhaenyra appreciated her efforts, they would not have the best relationship as mother and daughter because of the treatment of Levana's younger brothers. Still, the princesses tried to have a <em>"normal relationship"</em> as one would allow.</p><p>Levana is doted on by her Grandsire, King Viserys I Targaryen, who had become fond of her as she grew. While he would deny having favorites, it could be seen even by the common folk who the favorite was. Even Queen Alicent would dote on her - much to the surprise of King Viserys and Princess Rhaenyra. </p><p>It was quite easy for Levana to earn the affection of people - much so that Queen Alicent has warmed up to her exponentially. She's also become arguably close to the King's second son, Prince Aemond.</p><p>Many would call them an ideal match. </p><p>Some would say that they were destined lovers. </p><p>But Princess Levana and Prince Aemond were kindred souls brought together for a purpose.</p>

<p align="center">〖<em>Italics denote Valyrian speech.</em>〗</p><p> </p><p>It was nearly dusk when Rhaenyra had begun her labors. Immediately, the castle was filled with anticipation as maesters and handmaidens readied the Princess' chambers for the arrival of the new royal.</p><p>The wails of the princess could be heard across the castle as the Grand Maester assisted in her birth.</p><p>"Princess, you must breathe and push," The Grand Maester stated, "do not restrict yourself."</p><p>"I'm trying my best, bastard!" Rhaenyra hissed as another contraction happened which had her groaning.</p><p>"Ser Laenor? Where is my husband?!" Rhaenyra inquired as Harwin Strong made his way into her chambers, "he's on his way back from Driftmark, My Lady."</p><p>The princess would let out more cusses as her handmaidens prepared the baby's cradle. The Grand Maester approached Ser Harwin who stepped out of the princess' line of sight. The Maester took in a sharp breath as the Knight raised an eyebrow, "speak frankly with me, Maester," he spoke.</p><p>"She will have to deliver without Ser Laenor," The Grand Maester stated as Ser Harwin peered towards the princess, "we have no choice, we cannot delay the birth," he stated.</p><p>The Grand Maester bowed his head before making his way back to Princess Rhaenyra to assist in her birth.</p><p>"Whatever happens," Rhaenyra hissed, "do not let them cut me open."</p><p>Ser Harwin bowed his head in acknowledgment as Rhaenyra's labors pursued.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p><em>"Expect Seasmoke in an hour's time,"</em> One of the Dragonkeepers stated as Syrax's wails echoed through the walls of the Dragonpit.</p><p>One of the other Dragonkeepers emerged from one of the pits, shaking his head as he did so. The Harvest Moon was already peaking through the sky as Syrax continued to shriek and wail.</p><p><em>"The princess' child will be without a dragon," </em>The Head of the Dragonkeepers sighed, <em>"this is her first born and Syrax was not able to produce a clutch."</em></p><p><em>"Is this a bad omen?" </em>One of the Keepers asked, <em>"hardly."</em></p><p>A screech rumbled outside the Dragonpit and the keepers hurried outside to see Seasmoke; the dragon was hastily making his landing. Ser Laenor Velaryon tried his best to hold the reins of his dragon as he made his landing, not even hesitating to jump off Seasmoke the first chance that he got.</p><p>"Make haste, Ser Laenor," Ser Harrold Westerling stated as the Velaryon saddled the horse that the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard had brought with him, "the princess has been cursing at the maesters since her labors began and I do not think that they can handle more of the princess' tongue," he added.</p><p>"How far along is the princess from giving birth?" Ser Laenor asked as they began to ride towards the Red Keep, "a couple of hours in," Ser Westerling stated as the former took a deep breath and kicked the side of his horse, making the stallion gallop faster.</p><p>Laenor Velaryon was not about to miss the birth of his first child.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"Rhaenyra!" Ser Laenor called as he entered the Princess' chambers, the shouting of the princess could be heard loudly in the halls.</p><p>"Fuck you, Laenor!" Rhaenyra cursed, "I will have your head for this!" The princess threatened as her husband ran to her side, holding her hand tightly.</p><p>"I will be with you through this, Rhaenyra," Laenor promised as the princess groaned loudly, "I can't do it," she sighed.</p><p>"Your Grace, you must keep pushing," The Grand Maester stated, "the head has come," he informed them as Rhaenyra clutched Laenor's hand. The male excitedly looked at the Princess and then at the maester. He instructed the midwives to bring more cloths of cold water so that he may wipe the sweat off of Rhaenyra's forehead.</p><p>"Push, Princess," Instructed the Grand Maester as Rhaenyra did the best she could.</p><p>"I will not leave your side, Rhaenyra," Laenor whispered, "I will stay here until our child is born."</p><p>"I do hope so lest I cut off your cock," Rhaenyra muttered as she continued to push. Harwin stayed by the door and Laenor held tightly onto his wife's hand, soothing her as the maester continued to tend to the princess.</p><p>Hours must have passed but it felt longer than that when the loud cries of a baby finally rang through the Princess' chambers, Rhaenyra looked tiredly at the scene in front of her as the Grand Maester and the midwives began to clean the baby.</p><p>"It's a princess, Your Grace," The Grand Maester said as Ser Laenor looked at his wife proudly, "a new princess of our houses."</p><p>Soon enough, the baby was handed over to Rhaenyra who wrapped her arms around her. Ser Laenor watched as the princess hushed the baby into slumber.</p><p>On the night of the Harvest Moon, a princess was born to Houses Targaryen and Velaryon.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Hours after the birth, the maesters and the midwives have cleared out of Rhaenyra's room - leaving the princess and her husband with their child. Ser Laenor stood by the window, rocking the baby in his arms as Rhaenyra sat on one of the couches, watching them.</p><p>"We have yet to think of a name," Rhaenyra said, "have you given it some thought?"</p><p>"Her name will be Levana," Ser Laenor spoke as he looked upon Rhaenyra who smiled at him in response, "and she will rise like dragons and the moon," he added as the babe in his arms cooed in response.</p><p>"She seemed to like the name that you have given to her," Rhaenyra said as the male began to rock his daughter to sleep.</p><p>"You have an heir, Rhaenyra."</p><p>"I wouldn't want to think of her as that yet," the female sighed, "succession is beyond me still and I do not wish to burden it on my daughter who isn't even a day old."</p><p>Laenor nodded as he took a seat beside his wife, "thank you, Rhaenyra."</p><p>"Whatever for, Ser Laenor?"</p><p>"For allowing me this," Laenor stated, "for baring me a child."</p><p>"It's my regret that it isn't a son," Rhaenyra sighed, "Lord Corlys would've wanted a son to be your heir."</p><p>Laenor shook his head, "no, Rhaenyra, don't say such a thing."</p><p>"I am happy and proud of our daughter," Laenor said proudly, "Levana is my pride, and joy, and she will be so until the end of time."</p><p>The princess smiled and looked at their daughter. Laenor gently handed the babe to her mother and watched them.</p><p>"Levana Velaryon, the first of her name."</p><p>The doors to Rhaenyra's chambers opened and a very excited King Viserys walked inside the room. The King, despite his illness, was still quite strong and this was something that Rhaenyra prayed would last.</p><p>"Where is my grandchild?" He asked as Laenor stepped aside to reveal Rhaenyra and the newly born princess.</p><p>"A beautiful princess," King Viserys stated as he gently took the baby from his daughter, "what of her name?"</p><p>"We have decided to name her Levana, Your Grace," Laenor revealed as the King Viserys smiled, "a beautiful name for such a beautiful girl," he stated as the proud parents looked at each other with a smile.</p><p>"A true Velaryon," King Viserys stated with pride.</p><p>"You honor us with your words, Your Grace," Rhaenyra smiled as the King placed a kiss on his daughter's forehead.</p><p>"Congratulations to you both," King Viserys smiled as Queen Alicent walked into the room.</p><p>"Your Grace," Laenor and Rhaenyra said in unison as the Queen approached King Viserys to inspect the baby. She smiled slightly when she saw the silver roots on the babe's head before looking towards Rhaenyra.</p><p>"I hope that the birth was easy, princess."</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled, "Levana was a true angel," she chuckled, "it seems as though she did not want her mother to have a hard time."</p><p>Queen Alicent smiled at the remark before turning to acknowledge Ser Laenor, "congratulations."</p><p>"Thank you, Your Grace," The Velaryon responded as King Viserys continued to cradle the baby in his arms.</p><p>King Viserys would rock the baby in his arms, smiling proudly and happily as he walked around Rhaenyra's chambers. Levana cooed and the sight made the King smile in approval.</p><p>"You will make me the proudest Grandsire," King Viserys stated, "I just know of it."</p><p>"My King," Queen Alicent called as the male looked towards her, "I think it best if you rest for now," she smiled before turning to Rhaenyra, "the mother and child also need to rest."</p><p>The king nodded and walked over to his daughter, gently handing the baby to her, "congratulations," he whispered before heading to the door. Queen Alicent followed after the king and walked out of the room, closing the door behind them.</p><p>Laenor turned to Rhaenyra and smiled lovingly.</p><p>"I suppose now, you would want to do good on our agreement?" Rhaenyra asked as Laenor chuckled, "we'll discuss the arrangement when you are able," he stated as he kissed her forehead.</p><p>"For now, I think you and our daughter would like to rest," Laenor said as Rhaenyra stood from her seat and walked toward her bed. Her husband, on the other hand, placed Levana in her cradle.</p><p>"She doesn't have an egg," Laenor sighed as Rhaenyra smiled slightly, "she will find her dragon, Laenor," she assured.</p><p>"Gods forbid that our first child will not be a dragonrider like us," Rhaenyra stated as she looked at the cradle, "her Valyrian blood runs deep," she smiled.</p><p>Laenor nodded as he looked at the baby. Levana had nearly the same features as he did but her eyes were that of Rhaenyra's. She was beautiful and she would be the one to carry her family's banner when the time came.</p><p>Levana was, after all, Rhaenyra's one true heir.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" Rhaenyra asked as Ser Laenor looked at his distressed wife with a worried expression.</p><p>"Rhaenyra," Ser Laenor began, "Levana is three years old, she couldn't have gone too far."</p><p>The assurance from her husband did not appease the worry that bothered Rhaenyra to no end. She requested — no — <em>demanded</em> that the knights be mobilized to search for her daughter who had escaped from her nurse hours prior.</p><p>"It's supposed to be impossible to lose her," Rhaenyra gritted her teeth, "how hard would it be to find a small girl with silver hair?"</p><p>Laenor did not respond. Instead, he decided to make use of the time to look outside the windows to see if the princess had made her way into the gardens.</p><p>"She's not in the Godswood, Your Grace," Ser Westerling reported, earning a grunt of disbelief from Rhaenyra who decided to take the search into her own hands.</p><p>"I'm going to the pits," Rhaenyra announced, "who knows if she's gotten out of the castle," she added before hurriedly walking out of the room.</p><p>"Has anyone informed the King about the predicament?" Rhaenyra asked as Ser Westerling shook his head, "the King is busy in his chambers," he stated as the princess gave him a nod before heading towards her father's chambers.</p><p>"You need not go on dragonback," Laenor stated, "Levana won't be outside the palace."</p><p>"What makes you so sure, Laenor?" Rhaenyra asked, "she's small enough to fit anywhere."</p><p>Princess Rhaenyra walked hastily towards her father's chambers only to stop in her tracks when she heard faint laughter from the room.</p><p>"Did you...?" Rhaenyra trailed off as Laenor nodded in response. The princess would then knock on the King's door, "father? May I?"</p><p>"Come in," King Viserys called from the inside as the knights stationed outside the room opened the door. Rhaenyra entered in haste only to find that her daughter was seated on her Grandsire's lap, admiring the miniature statues that her father had built.</p><p>"You look panicked, Rhaenyra," King Viserys chuckled, "has something happened?"</p><p>"Levana escaped from her nurse," Rhaenyra explained as King Viserys looked at the little girl who had a dragon in her hands. Levana looked up at her mother and held out the dragon as if showing it to her.</p><p>"She's been here for hours," King Viserys stated, "my granddaughter has been keeping me company as I tell her stories of old."</p><p>Laenor looked at Levana and then at his wife with an amused smile, "thank you for looking after her, Your Grace," he bowed as the King waved his hand. "Levana is my granddaughter," King Viserys said, "I would gladly watch and entertain her."</p><p>Rhaenyra let out a sigh of relief before walking toward her father and daughter. She knelt beside them and pinched Levana's cheek, "you little troublemaker," she whispered as the little girl puffed her cheeks.</p><p>"She reminds me of another troublemaker that I know very well," King Viserys chuckled as Rhaenyra looked up at him, "I do hope she doesn't get into too much trouble as I won't be able to handle that," she smiled.</p><p>"Off you go then, little moon," King Viserys said as he gently handed the little girl over to her mother who took Levana in her arms with a smile. Rhaenyra and Laenor were about to leave the room when King Viserys called them back.</p><p>"Ser Westerling," King Viserys called as the knight entered the room and bowed his head, "from today, you will be looking after my granddaughter as her sworn protector while she resides in King's Landing."</p><p>Rhaenyra shook her head, "that won't be necessary, My King-"</p><p>King Viserys raised his hand, "do not argue with me on this, Rhaenyra," he stated, "I want what is best for my granddaughter and my grandchildren."</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at Laenor who bowed his head slightly as the former took a deep breath and looked at her father again, "thank you for your kindness, father."</p><p>King Viserys nodded as the two made their way out of the room with Levana who kept herself busy with the wooden dragon in her hand.</p><p>"Levana, what do you have to say for yourself?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana looked at her with a small yet apologetic smile, "I'm sorry, mother."</p><p>The older princess pressed a kiss on her daughter's cheek and chuckled, "don't run off from your nurse again, do you understand?"</p><p>Levana thought for a while and smiled, "I'll try, mother!"</p><p>Laenor laughed rather loudly as he accompanied his wife and daughter back to Rhaenyra's chambers where their younger son was waiting for them.</p><p>"Jace is no fun to play with," Levana complained, "that's why I went to look for Grandsire!"</p><p>Rhaenyra chuckled, "Jace? Is that what you call your brother?"</p><p>"Jace!" Levana repeated, "his name is too long so I made it shorter!"</p><p>Laenor crossed his arms and huffed in amusement, "Jacaerys has a special name from his older sister."</p><p>"Now, Levana, how did you find your way to the King's chambers?" Rhaenyra asked, "you've never been there without an escort."</p><p>"Aemond took me!"</p><p>"Aemond..?" Rhaenyra trailed off as she looked up at her husband, "the Queen's son?"</p><p>"Aemond!"</p><p>For a while, Rhaenyra couldn't believe what she had heard. She always thought that the King's other children kept a distance from them — let alone Levana. But as it turns out, she could be wrong.</p><p>"I shall have to thank the Queen then," Rhaenyra smiled, "if not for her son, you would've been truly lost."</p><p>Levana tilted her head slightly in confusion before nodding as if she had fully understood her mother. Laenor, on the other hand, decided to take Levana from Rhaenyra's arms and carried her.</p><p>"Where are you taking her?" Rhaenyra asked as Laenor made his way to the door, "I'm going to read to her in Godswood," he stated as he opened the door.</p><p>"Would you like to come with us?" Laenor asked as Rhaenyra shook her head and looked towards her younger son's cradle, "I'll keep an eye on Jace."</p><p>"You can keep an eye on our son while you spend time with us," Laenor stated as Rhaenyra shook her head, "I shall look forward to your company when you return for dinner," she stated as Laenor sighed in defeat before nodding and walking out the door.</p><p>"Are we really going to Godswood, father?" Levana asked as her father shook her head, "I'm going to introduce you to Seasmoke," he whispered as he headed for the stables.</p><p>Indeed, Levana was quite spoiled by two of the men in her life that we would love the most. </p>

<p>"Grandsire!"</p><p>A young Levana waddled towards King Viserys who stopped in his tracks. The princess would be six years of age now and she was closer to her Grandsire than ever. King Viserys would often deny that he had favorites — but Levana was a clear exception to that.</p><p>"Little princess," King Viserys smiled as the little girl stopped in front of him, "can I walk with you?" She asked as the king nodded and offered her his hand to take. Levana took his hand and they began to walk through the gardens of the Red Keep.</p><p>"I read about dragons," Levana shared, "I read in our books that among the old dragons, Vermithor resides in Dragonstone."</p><p>"Yes," King Viserys nodded, "Vermithor does reside in the caves of Dragonstone."</p><p>"I should claim him!" Levana said excitedly, "that would be nice, wouldn't it, Grandsire?"</p><p>King Viserys looked at his granddaughter adoringly, "yes, that would be fantastic, little moon."</p><p>Levana smiled proudly, "I'm going to claim Vermithor and I'm going to be the best dragonrider just like mother!"</p><p>"I have no doubt in my mind that you can do it, little moon," King Viserys smiled as they continued through the gardens. From the corner of her eye, she noticed someone watching them from a distance. Levana waved at whoever it was, earning a concerned look from the king.</p><p>"Who are you waving at, Levana?" King Viserys asked as Levana shrugged, "I thought I saw someone watching us from the flowers over there," she explained before pointing towards a tall flower pot.</p><p>King Viserys chuckled a response, "imaginative as ever."</p><p>Levana just smiled before walking back to the castle with her Grandsire.</p><p>"Will you join your Grandsire—"</p><p>As soon as King Viserys turned, he saw the small figure of Levana running back to the garden. He smiled, she reminded him of Rhaenyra when she was much younger. As the king was certain that knights would be around to look after his granddaughter, he began his walk back to his chambers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Levana was looking through the gardens to find whoever she had seen watching them. As she peeked through the pots and plants, she heard a thud from the distance; in a sign of victory, she hurried towards the direction of the sound and saw her uncle, Prince Aemond on the ground.</p><p>"Are you quite alright?" Levana asked, offering her hand to help the prince get up from the ground. Aemond stared at her and pushed himself off of the ground, ignoring the princess' outstretched hand.</p><p>"I don't need your help."</p><p>"But you fell," Levana stated, "and you have a small wound on your palm," she pointed as Aemond raised a brow. He turned his hand over to see that he had a <em>small </em>scratch that was bleeding slightly. The princess looked at him and took his hand in hers, inspecting the wound.</p><p>"Hey!" Aemond exclaimed, "how dare you touch me?"</p><p>Levana raised a brow, "for all that it is worth, I am your niece and I think I can touch you if it means helping you."</p><p>Aemond didn't have a comeback for that. Instead, he resigned himself to watching the princess inspect his wound with great concentration.</p><p>"Let's go get a maester," Levana smiled as she pulled Aemond towards the castle. The prince had no other choice but to follow the girl through the halls of the Red Keep.</p><p>"Do you know where you're going?" Aemond asked as Levana turned to him with a sheepish smile, "no," she responded truthfully.</p><p>"We're bound to come across a maester somewhere," Levana stated as she bumped into someone in the process of talking to Aemond. The princess slowly raised her head to see that she had bumped into Ser Westerling.</p><p>"Dare I ask where you two are off to, Princess Levana?" Ser Westerling inquired as Levana looked at Aemond before lifting up his hand to show the knight the scratch on it.</p><p>"I was looking for a maester," Levana said, "Aemond scratched himself while he was eavesdropping on me and Grandsire."</p><p>"I was not!"</p><p>"Why were you hiding then?"</p><p>Again, Aemond had no response.</p><p>The knight in front of them gave Levana a small smile before walking to her side, "allow me to escort the both of you, Your Grace."</p><p>Levana nodded and pulled Aemond closer to her side as they continued to walk towards the library where some of the maesters would surely be at.</p><p>Once they had entered the library and the maesters were made aware of the situation, they cleaned the small wound right away and bandaged it. Levana watched the entire process from beside Aemond - as young as she was, such things interested her.</p><p>"It should heal quickly, Your Highnesses," the maester said, "the wound was not too deep."</p><p>Levana looked at the prince with a smile as the maesters left the two children to their devices. Ser Westerling stationed himself nearby so he could keep a watchful eye on the young royals.</p><p>"Why did you help me?" Aemond asked as Levana shrugged, "you needed help," she replied.</p><p>"Are you expecting me to thank you?" The blonde prince asked as Levana chuckled a response. Aemond was surprised by it.</p><p>"You don't have to thank me," Levana smiled at him, "but you do look like you need a friend."</p><p>"I don't need a friend," Aemond responded.</p><p>"You didn't need help either but you still accepted it," Levana countered as the prince glared.</p><p>"Let's do this again," the princess cleared her throat, "I am Princess Levana Velaryon, the daughter of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Ser Laenor Velaryon," she curtsied as Aemond shook his head.</p><p>"I know who you are," Aemond scoffed as the princess crossed her arms, "I know that you do, <em>uncle."</em></p><p>"Don't call me that," The prince rolled his eyes, "we're only a year or two apart."</p><p>"Then what would you allow me to call you, Prince Aemond?"</p><p>The prince looked up at her, "just Aemond is fine..."</p><p>Levana clapped her hands in victory, "then I shall call you Aemond and you shall call me Levana."</p><p>Ser Westerling watched as the two conversed, an amused expression finding its way to his face as the princess began to pull out books from the library. He did not expect the prince to respond but he saw how Prince Aemond would listen to the young princess and respond to whatever it was she would tell him.</p><p>The knight would continue watching them in amusement as Levana's outgoing personality clashed with that of Aemond's silent one - yet the prince still tried his best to engage in the conversation with her.</p><p>It was amusing, to say the least. </p>

<p>Aemond and Levana's relationship only got better as they grew - much to the shock of their mothers who thought that they would outgrow their closeness with age. Of all people, King Viserys was the one who took delight in their relationship and would often smile to himself when he would see them talking together or reading history books in the library.</p><p>They've inherited the King's love for history as it seems.</p><p>It was very early in the morning when Levana found herself in the library, reading a book to drown out her mother's shouting. Her mother was giving birth to another sibling - much to her delight. Since her siblings, Jacaerys and Lucerys, were born, there was much more joy in their small family.</p><p>Though, there was always something about the way that people looked at her and her siblings that bothered her to no end. People always looked at her siblings differently and treated them differently - but they never looked at her that way.</p><p>Most of the time, Levana would ignore their stares and tell her brothers to do the same thing. But the whispers were very hard to ignore - especially for Levana.</p><p>Throughout her childhood, Levana developed an enhanced sense of hearing that may have gotten her into trouble once or twice. The maesters didn't know where she could've gotten it from nor if it would be permanent but still, the princess saw it as a blessing from the gods.</p><p>Levana heard the whispers about her father and her brothers - as well as Ser Harwin Strong who had been by their side for most of her childhood. Now, Levana didn't need to know or hear anything but she had her own assumptions as many would tell her - she was too young for them.</p><p>"Princess Levana," Ser Westerling called from the library doors as the princess looked at him from the book in her hands, "yes, Ser?" Levana asked.</p><p>"Ser Harwin Strong has arrived from the Dragonpit with your younger brothers," Ser Westerling stated as Levana closed the book and hopped off her chair. She dusted off her dress before walking to the knight and nodding to him.</p><p>"Has my mother given birth?" Levana asked as the knight nodded, "it seems that you have another brother," he said as Levana clapped her hands excitedly as she skipped towards her mother's chambers. She opened the doors to reveal her younger brothers with Ser Harwin.</p><p>For a moment, Levana paused. She noticed the way that Ser Harwin looked at them and it reminded her of the way that her own father would look at her as well. She cleared her throat as her younger brothers turned to her, running up and tackling her in an embrace.</p><p>"Ana, look at what we got for the babe!" Lucerys said excitedly as he took her sister's hand and showed her the dragon egg. There was a slight tinge of jealousy in Levana's eyes as she looked at the egg - how she yearned to have her own.</p><p>"Your brothers chose well, Your Grace," Ser Harwin commented as he placed a hand on Levana's shoulder. The princess wrapped her arms around the knight's waist and embraced him.</p><p>Ser Harwin was very close to her mother and, in turn, Levana had become close to him as well and often saw him as somewhat of an uncle to her.</p><p>"Little Lady, how are your studies?" Ser Harwin asked as Levana looked up at him and smiled, "they've been well!" She said, "the maesters say that I'm becoming better at my studies and soon, I'll know most of our family's history!"</p><p>The Commander of the City Watch looked at the Princess with adoring eyes and patted her head, "I'm glad that you're doing well."</p><p>"No fair!" Jacaerys crossed his arms, "Ana always gets the attention!" Lucerys joined in as Levana rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Oh, stop it you," Levana chuckled, "you two get attention from mother too."</p><p>The two boys looked at each other and laughed before embracing their sister. Ser Harwin watched them with an amused expression as they began to talk about dragons.</p><p>"Ana, if you were to have a dragon, which one would you want to have?" Jacaerys asked as the princess pursed her lips, "I want to ride Vermithor," she responded as the two boys looked at her in awe.</p><p>"Now, Little Lady," Ser Harwin began, "I do trust that you know well enough to not go into harm's way just for a dragon, yes?"</p><p>Levana looked up at him and nodded, "don't worry, Ser Harwin, I'll stay out of trouble."</p><p>"Why do I have my doubts?" The Knight asked as Levana chuckled nervously, "I'll <em>try </em>to stay out of trouble," the princess said, amending her statement.</p><p>Just as her younger brothers were flocking over Ser Harwin and telling him stories that they had heard of dragons from Levana, the doors opened to reveal Princess Rhaenyra and Ser Laenor with the new babe.</p><p>"Is that my new brother?" Levana asked as she ran towards her father, tip-toeing so she could see him. The princess looked at the babe with a warm smile and poked his cheek.</p><p>"What do we call him?" Levana asked as her father looked at her with a smile, "his name is Joffrey."</p><p>"Joffrey," Levana repeated, "I'll call him Joff!"</p><p>Laenor looked at her daughter with an amused smile as the little girl continued to try and entertain the little boy.</p><p>"Ser Harwin wishes to be introduced to Joffrey," Levana heard her mother say as Ser Laenor gently handed the babe over to the knight who looked at Joffrey adoringly.</p><p>"Time for the three of you to head to the Dragonpit," Ser Laenor stated as he began to escort Levana and her brothers out of the room.</p><p>"I don't want to go," Levana sighed, "the Dragonpit makes Aemond and I miserable."'</p><p>Laenor pinched his daughter's cheek, "you will have your dragon soon, little princess," he said, "I just know it," he promised as Levana's younger brothers took her by the hand and began to drag her away to the Dragonpit.</p>

<p>The Dragonpit was a place that Levana didn't like going to - especially since she had no dragon of her own. However, for the sake of learning, her brothers, and Aemond (who was in the same situation as her), she had to go.</p><p>Levana stood beside Aemond as the dragonkeeper instructed Jacaerys on how he should command his dragon. The princess made sure to take mental notes about each command as she listened in on them. She and the prince beside her would glance at each other repeatedly, trying to keep themselves occupied as the dragon training pursued.</p><p>"Ana, did you see that?" Jacaerys excitedly stated as he was successfully able to command his dragon, Vermax. Levana gave him a smile and a nod, "you did well, little brother."</p><p>"Aemond, we have a surprise for you!" Aegon said, placing a hand on Aemond's shoulder. Levana raised a brow as she saw Lucerys join in the conversation.</p><p>"What is it?" Aemond asked as Lucerys looked up at him, "something very special!" the younger boy stated as Levana leaned closer to Aemond, "I don't feel too good about this."</p><p>Lucerys then ran towards the pits, disappearing from view as Aegon pushed Levana aside. He blocked Aegon's view as he spoke, "you're the only one of us without a dragon," he stated as they began walking. Jacaerys also joined them as they neared the pits.</p><p>Levana raised a brow, walking behind them as she crossed her arms.</p><p>"We felt badly about it," Aegon continued, "so we found one for you."</p><p>"A dragon?" Aemond asked as his older brother nodded, "how?"</p><p>"The gods provide," Aegon smirked as Lucerys emerged from the pits with a pig.</p><p>"Behold," Aegon gestured towards the pig that was dressed to look like a dragon though it was far from it.</p><p>"The Pink Dread!"</p><p>Levana's eyes shot wide when she heard her younger brothers join in with Aegon.</p><p>"Jace, Luke," Levana called, "do you think this is funny?"</p><p>"It is!" Jacaerys responded as he pointed towards the pig, "look at it, Ana!"</p><p>"Apologize to Aemond," Levana said, "now."</p><p>"Oh, dear niece," Aegon sang, "let it be, a twat like him deserves a <em>dragon </em>of such caliber anyway."</p><p>Levana glared, "mother and father will know about this," she looked at her brothers, "make no mistake about it."</p><p>The princess began to walk away from the pits, her younger brothers looked at each other before running after her - afraid of what she might say to their parents.</p><p>"Ana, it was a joke," Jacaerys defended, "Aegon said it would be funny!"</p><p>"You hurt Aemond's feelings and by extension, mine!" Levana reasoned, "the both of you should know better."</p><p>The two princes looked at the ground as Levana boarded the carriage. The two boys followed suit, not daring to look up at their sister who sat in silence. While Levana felt bad for scolding her younger brothers, they had to learn a thing or two about the consequences of their actions.</p><p>"Whose idea was it?" Levana asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>"It was Aegon's," Lucerys said, "we swear it."</p><p>"I'm still going to tell mother and father about what you did," Levana sighed, "please do not do this again."</p><p>"We're sorry, Ana," Jacaerys muttered as the princess looked at his younger brothers with a soft smile, "remember that all actions have consequences and while we are of royal blood, we are not exempted from certain consequences," Levana lectured as the two boys gave her a nod.</p><p>As soon as they arrived back at the palace, a handmaiden made her way to the princess, taking her cloak from her.</p><p>"Your bath is ready, Princess Levana," the handmaiden stated as Levana turned to her and nodded, "thank you, Galatea," she said as the former gave her a smile and followed her into her room and then to her bath.</p><p>"How was dragon training today, Your Grace?" Galatea asked as Levana shrugged, "it was eventful, to say the least," the princess responded as she <em>almost </em>ungracefully jumped into the tub prepared for her.</p><p>Galatea was one of the handmaidens that had been with Levana since she was a toddler. The princess trusted her enough with certain matters and, in turn, they had become close friends - much more than that of a handmaiden and her mistress.</p><p>"Has Ser Harwin left?" Levana asked as the latter shook her head, "I do think that Ser Harwin is staying a bit longer," she responded as the princess hummed, sinking into the tub. A thought came into Levana's head as she looked at Galatea who was watching her from the door.</p><p>"Galatea," Levana began, "how long do you think it will take for me to wed?"</p><p>Galatea looked at the princess with an amused expression, "princess, you are only nine years, I doubt your mother or father will think of marrying you to a lord yet."</p><p>"If I were to marry," Levana thought for a while, "I think I want to marry either one of my brothers or Aemond."</p><p>Galatea took a deep breath, while she <em>wasn't </em>a Targaryen, she knows much of the family's customs to get her by without having to question anything.</p><p>"Well," Galatea smiled, "I'm sure that whoever you wed will be lucky to have you as a wife," she stated, "after all, you are one of the kindest hearts that I have met and you are also one of the most intelligent children."</p><p>Levana smiled at her, "will you stay with me as my handmaiden for life?"</p><p>"If you will have me for life," Galatea responded, "then I will serve you to the best of my abilities, my princess."</p><p>Just before Levana could get another word out, a knock came upon the door. Galatea excused herself as the princess stepped out to robe herself. Just as she exited the bath, her handmaiden came to her with her dress.</p><p>"The King wishes for you to watch the princes train with him," Galatea stated as Levana sighed, "I have no interest in such things," she muttered as the handmaiden helped her dress. While Levana was not a fan of swords and shields, she thought it would be best to watch and study for the knowledge in battle that might come in handy in the future.</p><p>Levana was dressed in a white dress with a lining of red along the edges. The dress also had in it gold buttons that bore the Velaryon crest. She also wore a necklace that had in it the Targaryen crest - this was her favorite ensemble.</p><p>Galatea had fixed her hair into a bun of intricate braids before the princess left her chambers. By her side was her sworn protector, Ser Westerling who tried his best to keep the princess in his line of sight.</p><p>"Ser Westerling," Levana began as the knight turned to her, "what is it, Your Grace?" he asked as Levana looked up at him and thought for a while.</p><p>"Do you think I'll ever get myself a dragon like my brothers?" The princess asked as the knight stopped in his tracks and knelt to meet the princess' height before sighing.</p><p>"Princess," The knight began, "I am in no place to give you a lecture but you are a Targaryen," he stated as Levana looked at him with a curious expression, "and I have no doubt in my mind that you will command one of the greatest beasts in the world."</p><p>Levana smiled, being without a dragon was one of her greatest insecurities, and having the people around her reassure her that she would soon have one was more than enough to make her smile again.</p><p>"Now, we must be off," Ser Westerling said as he stood up, "the King is waiting for you in the fields."</p><p>With that, Levana happily walked beside the knight - contented and convinced that she might soon have her own dragon.</p>

<p>"Grandsire!"</p><p>"There she is," King Viserys smiled as Levana ran to him. She kissed his cheek before bowing to acknowledge Lord Lyonel Strong, the King's Hand. Lord Lyonel bowed as well to acknowledge the princess who would take a seat opposite her Grandsire.</p><p>It was often like this. As Levana wasn't allowed much freedom to hold a sword because of her mother, she would resign herself to watching her younger brothers and uncle train with Ser Cole.</p><p>It delighted Levana to see that Ser Harwin was joining them today. The princess waved at the knight who, in turn, gave her a wave as well. An action that greatly pleased King Viserys who was watching the little girl.</p><p>"This is the stuff, Lyonel," King Viserys spoke as he gestured to the boys, "lads that learn and train together, knock each other down, and help each other up," he added as Levana listened to her Grandsire.</p><p>"They will certainly form a lifelong bond, don't you agree?" King Viserys asked as The Hand shrugged slightly, "that is the hope, Your Grace," he responded before the King looked at Levana.</p><p>"If training and learning together will not bond them, they have Levana to straighten them up."</p><p>Levana giggled at the King's remark before watching her younger brothers train. Arguably, there was a visible difference between the fighting skills of the younger boys compared to their uncles.</p><p>"Grandsire," Levana said, "would I be able to hold a sword?"</p><p>King Viserys chuckled slightly, "if your mother would humor your request then I shall grant it."</p><p>Levana's eyes lit up with hope before she turned to the battlefield. Watching the fight between Aegon and Jacaerys with much interest. What started as a friendly bout turned into something that was close to violent as Aegon ruthlessly attacked Jacaerys until Ser Harwin stopped him.</p><p>From the balcony, Levana could hear Ser Cole's comments towards Ser Harwin and without a moment's notice, the former began to attack the latter.</p><p>"Princess," Lord Lyonel said as he blocked Levana's view from the violence that was happening in the field.</p><p>"My brothers-" Levana managed to say as she was escorted back to the castle by knights. Ser Westerling had met them halfway and commanded the knights to leave.</p><p>"Ser Westerling," The princess began, "what's going to happen to Ser Harwin?" She asked.</p><p>The knight looked at her with an unsure expression, "I cannot say for sure, princess," he responded as Levana looked down at the floor as they continued to walk towards the princess' quarters.</p><p>"Will you please let me know what will come of Sir Harwin?" Levana asked as she stopped in front of her door, the knight sighed before nodding reluctantly.</p><p>"I will try my best, princess," Ser Westerling promised, "but know that I might not be able to stop it."</p><p>Levana shrugged, "I know," she replied, "I just don't want my brothers to be sad."</p><p>Ser Westerling nodded and gestured for the princess to enter her quarters, "rest easy, princess."</p><p>The princess gave him a nod before retreating to her quarters. She looked around to try to find Galatea but to her surprise - Aemond was seated on one of the couches, reading a book.</p><p>"It's rude to be in a female's quarters without her permission, you know," Levana said as Aemond looked up at her.</p><p>"I know," Aemond responded, "I just know that my mother won't come looking for me here," he added as the princess took a seat beside him, peering over the book that he was reading. Levana recognized it as a book on Targaryen family history - one of her favorites.</p><p>"Did you do something again?" Levana asked, "you never usually come to hide here unless you did something."</p><p>Aemond looked at her and sighed, "mother scolded me."</p><p>"For what?"</p><p>"Levana, I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>Levana crossed her arms, "you are hiding in my quarters, the least you could do is to provide me with the reason why you are here."</p><p>Aemond huffed, "I explored the pits to look for a dragon again."</p><p>"See? Was it so hard?" Levana asked as she turned her attention to the book again, recognizing the page as one that told the story of Visenya Targaryen.</p><p>"My mother loves that name."</p><p>The prince looked at her, "Visenya?"</p><p>Levana nodded, "but she allowed my father to name me thus I didn't have the name."</p><p>"Do you wish to have that name?" Aemond asked as Levana nodded, "it would've been nice to be named after my mother's hero."</p><p>Aemond closed the book and turned to Levana, "I like your name," he said, "you are the first in our family to have it."</p><p>Levana smiled at him, "you're too kind to me, Aemond."</p><p>"I'm only kind to you because you were also kind to me," Aemond responded, "and I like spending time with you."</p><p>"Do you really?" Levana asked, "I find myself a bore."</p><p>Aemond shook his head, "you never bore me and you will never do so."</p><p>Levana blinked, "well, I..."</p><p>The prince rubbed the back of his neck and chuckled, "that was awkward."</p><p>"No, not at all!" Levana responded, "it's just rare for me to encounter such a compliment."</p><p>"Most people do see you as eccentric," Aemond chuckled, "but I do not mind it."</p><p>The blonde prince placed a hand on top of Levana's and smiled slightly, "I enjoy your company very much."</p><p>Just as Levana was about to speak, her doors opened to reveal her father and mother with a stern expression. Rhaenyra's eyes shot wide open when she saw the prince inside her daughter's room but remained calm.</p><p>"Prince Aemond," Rhaenyra called, "we would like a moment with Levana."</p><p>Aemond nodded bitterly and hopped off the couch. He bid farewell to Levana before leaving the room, Ser Westerling closing the door to give the family some privacy.</p><p>"What was Aemond doing in your room?" Rhaenyra asked sternly.</p><p>"We were just studying history," Levana said truthfully, "we were talking about Visenya Targaryen."</p><p>Rhaenyra took a deep breath and sighed, "you cannot have boys inside your room without company, Levana."</p><p>Levana puffed her cheeks, "Aemond is my friend."</p><p>"That's what they want you to think," Rhaeynra mumbled as she took a seat beside her daughter who moved away from her.</p><p>"Why have you come, mother? Father?"</p><p>Laenor looked at Rhaenyra with a sigh, "we have news to break, little princess."</p><p>Levana's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"We're leaving for Dragonstone."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," Levana complained, "I don't want to go to Dragonstone!"</p><p>Rhaenyra took a deep breath as she looked at Levana with patient eyes, "Levana, my love, there are things that we have to do and this is one of them."</p><p>"I don't want to leave the Red Keep!" Levana stomped her foot as her siblings were loaded onto the boat that would take them to Dragonstone, "all my life, I have lived here and I do not want to leave!"</p><p>"Levana," Rhaenyra said sternly, "do not test me."</p><p>"I am not testing you, mother," Levana responded, "I just do not look forward to leaving my life in the Red Keep."</p><p>"Life in the Red Keep or Aemond?" Jacaerys asked from the boat as Levana glared at her younger brother, "be quiet Jace!"</p><p>"Oh, so it's because of Prince Aemond?" Rhaenyra raised a brow as Levana shook her head and grabbed her luggage from Galatea before running towards the boat, pinching Jacaerys' cheek as she passed by him.</p><p>"So it is Aemond," Rhaenyra chuckled as Laenor approached them with Joffrey in his arms, "Prince Aemond is here," he whispered to his wife as he boarded the boat. The princess looked at Ser Westerling who had the said prince by his side.</p><p>"The young prince would like to bid farewell to Princess Levana," Ser Westerling said as Princess Rhaenyra smiled slightly before nodding her head and calling for Levana.</p><p>Levana walked back to the deck from one of the rooms with Lucerys trailing behind her. She looked from beyond the boat and waved at Aemond. Rhaenyra gestured for her daughter to come closer to which Levana obliged and walked to her mother.</p><p>"I am sad to see you go, princess," Ser Westerling said as Levana smiled, "will you still be my protector when I come back to King's Landing?" She asked as the knight nodded.</p><p>"I am sworn to you, princess," Ser Westerling smiled, "I will protect you for life."</p><p>The knight then gestured for Prince Aemond to step forward to say his farewells to the princess. Rhaenyra did the same thing, pushing Levana forward a tad bit so she could talk to Aemond.</p><p>"The Red Keep will be boring," Aemond began, "I won't have you to nag at me all day."</p><p>Levana pinched his cheek, "I won't have you to disturb all day at Dragonstone," she giggled as Aemond handed her a book. The princess recognized it as one of the history books that they always read at the library.</p><p>"Septa Adara and Septon Tarian won't be happy that this book is missing from the library," Levana lectured as she took the book from him with a smile, "but thank you, Aemond."</p><p>The prince smiled and turned her back to the princess, "will you come on my Name Day to visit me?"</p><p>Levana turned to her mother for approval who smiled at her and nodded. The princess hummed an approval, "as long as you will have cake then I will be there, Aemond!"</p><p>Aemond turned to face her slightly before nodding and walking back to Ser Westerling's side. On the other hand, Levana bowed to the prince before heading back to the boat. Aemond and Ser Westerling stayed as the boat started to sail away from the port.</p><p>"Farewell, Aemond!" Levana waved as the prince waved back. Laenor walked to his daughter's side and placed a hand on her shoulder, "we'll visit."</p><p>The princess looked up at her father and nodded, "I will miss my Grandsire," she stated as Laenor nodded in agreement, "we will be in Dragonstone, we will be closer to my mother and father."</p><p>Levana nodded, "father?"</p><p>"Yes, princess?" Laenor asked as Levana looked at the book in her arms before shaking her head and walking away from him.</p><p>"What's the matter, Levana?" Laenor asked but the princess would remain silent, instead, she would proceed to her cabin to sit on one of the beds. The former could only follow her and sit beside her as the princess set the book aside and sighed heavily.</p><p>"We will return to King's Landing when we can," Laenor promised, "you'll have more time to spend with your brothers when we arrive in Dragonstone."</p><p>"Will mother be okay if she is away from Grandsire?" Levana asked, "I know that they care for each other very much."</p><p>Laenor wrapped an arm around his daughter and pulled her closer to him, "we will be alright, Levana," he assured, "your mother is a strong woman and your Grandsire will always have us in his heart."</p><p>Princess Levana sighed and embraced her father. Deep inside, Laenor knew that moving to Dragonstone would be a big step for his daughter who spent most of her life in the Red Keep. Contrary to her brothers, she would have the most attachment to the place and the people there.</p><p>"Tell you what," Laenor began, "we can go to King's Landing on dragonback every once in a while."</p><p>Levana's eyes lit up.</p><p>"But I don't have a dragon," The princess' smile quickly turned upside down, "will there be dragons in Dragonstone?"</p><p>"There are," Laenor began, "but Levana, you are far too young to approach any of those dragons."</p><p>"Vermithor resides there," Levana stated, "Grandsire once told me that he was much more tolerant to men which means that I might have a chance!"</p><p>Laenor smiled slightly, he didn't want to get her hopes up - especially when he was sure that mounting a dragon at her age wasn't going to be an easy feat. Prince Laenor hopes that his daughter would be willing to wait just a bit more to claim a dragon.</p><p>But of course, Princess Levana had other things in mind - she wasn't about to let the opportunity to claim a dragon for herself pass her by.</p><p>She would just have to wait for the ideal timing to be able to sneak off to the Dragonmont where the Dragonkeepers of King's Landing said Vermithor resided.</p><p>That, in itself, was no easy feat.</p>

</p><p> </p><p>Levana was, in many ways, a cunning child.</p><p>After settling in Dragonstone, she made a point to befriend the dragonkeepers - they would know where Vermithor resided and she was not disappointed. In a span of two weeks, Levana was able to discover the whereabouts of the beast.</p><p>Her next step was to find out how she could possibly go there without being followed or discovered by the keepers, her brothers, Galatea, and her parents.</p><p>That was a long list of people that she needed to avoid but Levana was determined to make it work.</p><p>Levana managed to explore the castle enough as well to discover the fastest way to get to the stables. She knew a little bit of riding thanks to Sir Westerling who had taught her just before she left King's Landing - Levana would use that to her advantage when she would attempt to find Vermithor.</p><p>As soon as she was certain that her parents were asleep, Levana snuck out of her room and hurriedly but carefully made her way to the stables. She was careful to avoid any guards that were stationed near her chambers.</p><p>She was able to navigate through the halls and found the stables easy enough but to her surprise, Galatea was waiting there with her arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>"Princess, it seems that my instincts to come here were not wrong."</p><p>Levana shook her head, "I couldn't find sleep and I was just explor—"</p><p>"Do you really believe that when a horse is saddled and ready to leave in the middle of the night?" A voice from behind her said as Levana groaned in defeat.</p><p>Ser Laenor walked towards his daughter with a look of disappointment on his face.</p><p>"Father, I just—"</p><p>"I know what you were about to do, Levana," Laenor sighed, "do you know how dangerous that could've been?"</p><p>The princess nodded before walking to the saddled horse, "I just wanted to see if I could get a dragon..."</p><p>Laenor sighed, "not like this, Levana."</p><p>Levana looked at her father in defeat before sighing, "I apologize, father..."</p><p>The knight nodded and walked past Levana, "let's go get some tea to help you find sleep."</p><p>The princess paused as Galatea excused herself and went ahead. Laenor began to walk away from the stables, stopping slightly when he realized that Levana was not following after him.</p><p>His eyes widened at the realization that the doors to the stables were forced open and he could see the disappearing figure of a horse through the woods.</p><p>"Levana!"</p><p>Ser Laenor was cursing at himself as he proceeded to run towards another horse. Galatea looked panicked as she ran out of the stables.</p><p>"Tell my wife that our daughter has gone to the Dragonmont!"</p><p>With the order, Laenor rode out of the castle and into the forest. Galatea was left to wake the Queen and the boys to alert them of what happened.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana wasn't even able to saddle her horse properly when she jumped on him. The princess was hanging on her horse tightly as the steed rushed through the forest in haste. Aimlessly rushing past trees as it did so.</p><p>"Just a little more," Levana told herself as she held the reins tightly so she wouldn't fall. The princess was hardly seated on the saddle in the first place, she was quite literally hanging on the horse as it made its way through the thick greenery.</p><p>The princess was certain that her father had followed her which would mean that she only had a small window of time to find Vermithor.</p><p>While the princess was very certain that there was a chance that she wouldn't be successful, at the very least, she knew that she tried.</p><p>She saw the Dragonmont at a closer distance — she wasn't about to give up when she was so close to finally getting what she wanted. She willed for the horse to go faster and by gods, that was the fastest she's ever been on a horse.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"Levana did what?!"</p><p>Galatea looked down as Princess Rhaenyra summoned her handmaidens who came running into her chambers without a moment's notice.</p><p>"Help me dress," Rhaenyra ordered as she began to disrobe, "quickly!"</p><p>The handmaids quickly got to work to help the princess get dressed as Galatea took it upon herself to check on Levana's younger brothers who were awoken by the sudden commotion.</p><p>"Mother?" Jacaerys asked, rubbing his eyes as he walked into his mother's room with Galatea and Lucerys.</p><p>"You will stay with Galatea and the nurses," Rhaenyra stated, "your father and I have to retrieve Levana."</p><p>"What happened to Ana?" Lucerys asked as his mother shook her head and proceeded to kiss her sons' foreheads before making her way out of the room. She proceeded to one of the towers where she would call upon her dragon, Syrax, who came soon after.</p><p><em>"We have to find Levana,"</em> Rhaenyra stated as the dragon bellowed and flew off.</p><p>In her head, Rhaenyra was fearing for the worst — she had a rough estimate of the dragons that made home in Dragonstone and not all of them were accustomed to humans.</p><p>There was a clock to beat and Rhaenyra had to move fast.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana successfully arrived at the Dragonmont, she let go of her horse's reins and took a torch before proceeding inside. She didn't know where to start looking but there was definitely something pulling her in a particular direction.</p><p>She couldn't explain it but there was just a pull that was telling her where to go.</p><p>The princess felt her heart thumping against her chest and the pulse in her ears as she heard growls from almost every direction. It made her ears ring as she continued deeper into the Dragonmont.</p><p>She stopped by a chamber's entrance and immediately, she walked inside — she was drawn to it.</p><p>Levana raised her torch higher and the sight that greeted her was scary just as it was terrific.</p><p>There he was, the Bronze Fury in his full glory — unleashing his flames to the cavern's ceiling.</p><p>Levana had one chance.</p><p>This was it. </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Ser Laenor finally reached the Dragonmont and clicked his tongue at the sight of his daughter's horse outside of it. He spotted Syrax enough which indicated that Rhaenyra had also already gone inside the cavern - he allowed his horse to calm down and tied its reins on the tree and moved to find his way to the caverns.</p><p>"Laenor," Rhaenyra called from the opening as the knight rushed towards his wife, "what took you so long?"</p><p>"I was on horseback, Rhaenyra," Laenor responded as he looked beyond where they were standing - a chill ran up his spine as an unholy image of his daughter in the claws of a dragon came into his head.</p><p>"Do not," Rhaenyra sighed, "she's smart enough to find her way out of the deadliest things."</p><p>"But these are dragons, Rhaenyra," Laenor reminded as the princess just shook her head as they continued their way into the caverns.</p><p>"How could you let her go?"</p><p>"She climbed on the horse, Rhaenyra," Laenor defended, "she was out of the stables before I could even blink."</p><p>"How did she even get on a horse?"</p><p>"She was hardly on the horse," Laenor chuckled, "you would laugh if you saw it as she was half hanging on the horse."</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled, "well, she never got proper lessons from Ser Harold," she explained, "but I would like to assume that she knew enough to control the horse."</p><p>The two would continue to traverse through the caverns, hoping that they would find their daughter in one piece.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana was in front of Vermithor as the beast roared at her. The princess stood her ground and held up her hand.</p><p>She was shaking as she did so - he was much bigger than she had expected.</p><p>"Vermithor," Levana gulped, <em>"serve me."</em></p><p>The beast raised its head and continued to unleash its flames, for a while, Levana thought to run but she was already there.</p><p>Vermithor was the one dragon that she wanted to be a rider of.</p><p>"Vermithor," Levana called again, <em>"calm."</em></p><p>The dragon lowered its head to meet the princess, it looked at her intensely. Levana slowly inched closer to the dragon as the beast observed her.</p><p><em>"Serve me," </em>Levana commanded, <em>"obey and serve me, Vermithor!"</em></p><p>The beast bellowed as it slowly opened its mouth. Levana was nearly frozen in fear and couldn't retract her hand - she was ready to have it bitten off when Vermithor unleashed flames into the cavern's ceiling once more. The princess looked up to see another dragon peering down at them.</p><p>
<em>"Dracarys."</em>
</p><p>Vermithor breathed fire towards the other dragon who unleashed a mighty roar before disappearing - it was one that Levana would surely remember. The Bronze Fury turned his head back to the princess who smiled slightly before walking closer to it, her arm still extended.</p><p>The dragon lowered its head once more and inched towards the princess, his snout meeting Levana's hand as the princess smiled at the contact.</p><p>
<em>"Serve me, Vermithor."</em>
</p><p>Vermithor would then lower its body completely for the princess to climb. Levana's heart was thumping loudly as she walked towards the dragon's neck, her hand not leaving the dragon's skin as she took a deep breath and began to climb the dragon.</p><p>As if the dragon knew that the princess was having a difficult time mounting him, he tried to shake his head to help the princess.</p><p>Levana laughed with glee as she finally mounted the dragon. The Bronze Fury spread its wings and waited for an order from its new rider.</p><p>The princess took a deep breath, <em>"fly, Vermithor."</em></p><p>At the command, Vermithor began to flap its wings and ascend for the sky. For a while, all Levana could see was absolute darkness until <em>her </em>dragon broke through the ceiling - the view from her dragon was breathtaking.</p><p>She shouted with glee as Vermithor unleashed a loud roar before soaring higher into the sky and into the clouds. Levana held tightly on the dragon as they did so - never did she imagine that she would finally ride Vermithor.</p><p>The princess looked at the moon, her eyes widening at the sight of it. Her mind started to go blank as she continued to look at it — she was trapped in a daze, a vision appearing before her as she stared at it.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>The moon was full and bright — Levana recognized it as the Harvest Moon that rose the highest during the night of her Name Day. She realized that she was in a castle that she had never set foot in before.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>It was not the Red Keep or Dragonstone or Driftmark.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>The young princess wandered through the halls, passing by people who seemed to pay her no attention until she reached what she would recognize as a council room.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>The room had in it a Painted Table that was adorned with gold. Beneath it was a hearth that seemed to make the table glow from within.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>At the end of the table was a female wearing a crown of gold and rubies. It wasn't anyone that Levana knew or anyone that seemed familiar to her. The princess continued to stare at the figure at the end of the table until she lifted her head to face the young princess.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>

</p><p align="center">
<em>The princess was startled. She had been caught, it seems.</em>
</p><p align="center">

</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>The female called again until the entire room turned dark.</em>

</p><p>Levana snapped out of her trance to see her mother flying just beside her on Syrax.</p><p>"Land <b>your </b>dragon," Rhaenyra stated, "now."</p><p>The younger princess blinked as she tried to look for the moon that was now hidden behind the clouds.</p><p>"Levana Velaryon!" Princess Rhaenyra called again, "I will not ask twice."</p><p>Levana stroked the side of Vermithor's neck and leaned forward so the dragon could hear her command, <em>"land near the castle."</em></p><p>Vermithor growled slightly as he made his descent. Syrax would follow after and as the larger dragon landed, Levana patted his scales, <em>"thank you, Vermithor."</em></p><p>The Bronze Fury slowly lowered himself so the princess could unmount him. It was quite difficult but Levana managed to get off her dragon only to be greeted by her mother who wore a look of anger and worry.</p><p>"What has gotten into you?" Rhaenyra asked, embracing her tightly, "we could've lost you, Levana."</p><p>The younger princess smiled slightly and wrapped her arms around her mother's waist, "I'm sorry, mother," she whispered as Rhaenyra sighed and stroked her hair before looking at the Bronze Fury who seemed to make himself comfortable in a corner of the courtyard.</p><p>"You have a dragon," Rhaenyra smiled as Levana turned to Vermithor with a wide smile.</p><p>

<p>The news of Princess Levana's claim on Vermithor spread like wildfire and soon enough, she received gifts from her grandparents to better help her prepare for life as a dragonrider. As her dragon was the largest among her siblings, the princess would be able to train to ride sooner than her brothers.</p><p>Levana received riding gear from both her Grandsires. King Viserys also gifted her with a saddle - all the gifts were promptly delivered to Dragonstone just days after news reached her grandparents. Levana was, of course, elated to receive the gift from them and was excited to try her new items.</p><p>"I can't believe it, Ana," Jacaerys gazed upon the Bronze Fury as the dragonkeepers fastened the saddle unto him, "you finally have Vermithor!"</p><p>Levana smiled at her younger brother before looking at her dragon, there were no words that could describe the happiness and excitement that she felt.</p><p>Ever since she was young, she had always wanted to ride Vermithor.</p><p>She was finally able to do it.</p><p><em>"Princess," </em>One of the keepers called, <em>"your mount is ready."</em></p><p>Levana nodded and walked towards Vermithor, <em>"calm," </em>she whispered as the dragon lowered his neck for the princess.</p><p>"Look at you," Rhaenyra said as she walked towards her daughter with a proud and nostalgic smile, "you remind me of someone that I used to know."</p><p>The younger princess smiled at her mother as she mounted Vermithor. The dragon shook a bit before spreading its wings.</p><p>
<em>"Fly."</em>
</p><p>At the command, the large beast took to the skies.</p><p>"Look at you," Ser Laenor called from his own mount, Seasmoke, who flew just beside Vermithor.</p><p>Levana looked at her father with glee as the Bronze Fury roared mightily into the skies.</p><p>"Don't be too bold," Laenor stated, "you're still getting used to riding and it's important that you get a feel of your dragon's temperament."</p><p>Levana took note of her father's advice as she stroked Vermithor's neck. The dragon grumbled as he continued to fly.</p><p>Laenor watched his daughter with glee. He knows just how much Levana waited for the day that she could take to the skies with her own dragon.</p><p>As a father, it was fulfilling to see his daughter finally live out a dream that she's wanted since she was a child.</p><p>"Levana," Laenor began, "let's see how good you and Vermithor are at landing."</p><p>The princess nodded with excitement as Vermithor flew steadily, waiting for a command.</p><p>The sight of Levana riding Vermithor was a proud moment for Laenor.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>In the span of a few months, Levana was allowed to fly Vermithor around the castle unsupervised. She was also able to ride to Driftmark with the guidance of her father.</p><p>Princess Rhaenys was proud to see her first grandchild on such a beast. Lord Corlys made sure that Levana would have more riding gear to wear. The princess got to spend more time with her paternal grandparents as Driftmark was the only other place she was allowed to fly to.</p><p>Whenever she would ask to fly to King's Landing to see her Grandsire, her mother would always dismiss the thought saying that the Dragonpit was not built to hold something as big as Vermithor. Levana would just let it go and attempt to ask another time though she always knew that the answer would be the same.</p><p>She never understood why they had to leave King's Landing in the first place - she felt most at home there but she knew her mother had reasons. She's <em>heard </em>some of them but she would always shrug it off as it wasn't something that she was meant to hear in the first place.</p><p>Today, Levana was flying around Dragonstone Castle. This is what her daily flights usually looked like. A couple of rounds around the castle, a round or two around the island itself, and back. It wasn't the most enriching ride but Levana would rather have it than none at all.</p><p>Her flight was interrupted by the sight of her father waving at her from one of the castle towers. She commanded Vermithor to land near the courtyard where she was greeted by her mother with a letter in her hands.</p><p>"Has something happened, mother?" Levana asked as Rhaenyra nodded.</p><p>"It's your Aunt Laena," Rhaenyra began, "we've lost your aunt."</p><p>Levana wasn't by all means close to her Aunt Laena or any of her cousins from her line but she was family and her father loved his sister very much. However, as young as she is, she didn't know how to properly react to having lost someone like that.</p><p>"We're headed to Driftmark in a few days' time," Rhaenyra stated as she began to walk back into the castle. Levana followed after her mother, "will Grandsire be there?"</p><p>"We will be hosted by Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys," The older princess responded as Levana shook her head, "I meant my grandsire, the King."</p><p>Rhaenyra stopped in her tracks before looking at her daughter with a small smile, "yes, King Viserys will be there."</p><p>Levana's face turned bright as she came to the realization that she would be reunited with her Grandsire after months of being away from each other. She missed the king dearly and cannot wait to share with him the story of how she managed to claim Vermithor and how her flights with her dragon have been.</p><p>"Aemond will be there as well," Rhaenyra chuckled, "did you think I've forgotten?"</p><p>The young princess' face bore a hint of pink at the mention of the name, Levana froze as her mother pinched her cheek.</p><p>"I was teasing, Levana," Rhaenyra smiled, "unless, of course, you think of Aemond differently."</p><p>Levana shook her head, "I think of Aemond as a friend!"</p><p>Rhaenyra raised a brow, "a friend, of course," she chuckled, "a friend that you spend most of your time with, yes."</p><p>"Mother!" Levana raised her voice slightly as Rhaenyra raised her arms in defeat.</p><p>"You seem to be really affected for someone who only thinks of my brother as a friend," The older princess teased once more as Levana puffed her cheeks and began to walk off. Rhaenyra watched her daughter in amusement before walking behind her with a wide smile.</p><p>The conversation gave Rhaenyra an idea but she would have to run it by Laenor. Still, she thought of it as a bright one. </p>

<p>The journey to Driftmark was short yet painstakingly long — especially for Levana who volunteered to fly on dragonback alongside her father. Ser Laenor was almost inconsolable when the news of his sister's death came about. The young princess hoped that flying with her father would somehow take his mind off what happened but unfortunately, Ser Laenor wouldn't talk until they landed in Driftmark.</p><p>It was late in the afternoon when they all gathered by the sea to bid their final farewell to Laena Velaryon. The events leading to the burial were a blur Levana hadn't found the time to even talk to or greet her other family members.</p><p>She had to be there for her father and her grandparents.</p><p>Levana stood beside her father, her arms wrapped around his waist as Laenor placed a hand on her head, stroking her hair.</p><p>Her Great Uncle, Vaemond, stood across them and presided over the rights.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>We gather here today at the Seat of the Sea to commit Lady Laena of House Velaryon to the eternal waters - the dominion of the Merling King and he will guard her for all the days to come.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>As she sets for the sea on her final voyage, the Lady Laena leaves her two true-born daughters on the shore.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Levana looked towards her cousins and her grandparents. Her heart aches for them to have lost their mother so young.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Though their mother will not return from her voyage, they will all remain bound together in blood.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>Salt courses through Velaryon blood.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There was a sudden shift in the atmosphere when Vaemond Velaryon mentioned the word <em>blood</em>. Instantly, she saw the King turn towards her mother who had Jacaerys and Lucerys in each of her arms.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Ours runs thick and true.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>Ours must never thin.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Vaemond then turned to Levana with a small smile. It irked her for some reason that he looked that way toward her but looked at her mother and brothers with such scorn.</p><p>The tension only died down ever so slightly when Daemon Targaryen, the husband of the late Lady Laena, laughed out of the blue. Levana saw it as rude - especially since it was his wife that they were burying. But she had no say in the matter, especially since she was never close to their side of the family.</p><p>Though, she did know from stories that her mother had an affinity for Daemon.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>My gentle niece.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>May the winds be as strong as your back, your seas as calm as your spirit, and your nets be as full as your heart.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>From the sea we came, to the sea we will return.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>As Vaemond ended the rights, Lady Laena's coffin was sent to the sea to become one with the waves. The differences in burial rights often made Levana think.</p><p>Would she be sent to the sea like a Velaryon or would she burn in the pyre like a Targaryen?</p><p>Now that she is a dragonrider, she might be given the grace of a dragonrider's death once her time comes.</p><p>Once the crowd was dispersed from the sea, Levana found herself in the presence of her cousins, Rhaena and Baela. She tried her best to comfort them though she was not always the best at comforting others except for her siblings.</p><p>Jacaerys approached them. Levana knew that her brother wasn't the best at comforting others, but he was glad that he decided to join them - even if they had to sit in silence.</p><p>Their grandmother soon arrived to extend her comfort as well. Levana gestured for Jacaerys to leave and the younger boy nodded before moving towards a fire pit. Levana placed a hand on her brother's head and ruffled it slightly, "it'll be fine."</p><p>Jacaerys leaned closer to his sister and sighed as they watched the fire. A figure approached them - one that Levana recognized all too well.</p><p>"I'm sorry for your loss," Aemond muttered as Levana smiled, "thank you, Aemond."</p><p>"Shall I leave?" Jacaerys looked up at his sister who chuckled a response. Levana looked at Aemond with a small smile and nodded as the other prince did the same before leaving the two. The younger male looked at Levana and held her hand tightly.</p><p>"We should be at Harrenhal," Jacaerys whispered. The comment made Levana turn to her brother with concern.</p><p>"Do not let them hear you," Levana whispered back, "we are Velaryons," she stated.</p><p>"You're the Velaryon," Jacaerys responded.</p><p>Levana hugged her brother tightly, "<b>this</b> is our family, Jace, we need to be here for them."</p><p>Jacaerys embraced his older sister tightly as Levana did the same. She could hear the sniffles of her younger brother and kissed the top of his head, "it will be alright, Jace, I'm here."</p><p>As Levana comforted her younger brother, she couldn't help but notice the commotion that her Grandsire, Lord Corlys, was stirring when he approached one of the knights of their house, Ser Qarl. She paid no attention to it but watched the knight leave with a couple of others before disappearing out of view.</p><p>The night was slowly creeping in when Levana watched her brothers retreat to their quarters after their mother's request. The younger princess was left to her own devices, much so that she decided to approach Aemond.</p><p>"I heard of your claim to Vermithor," Aemond began, "did you receive the gloves that I sent you?"</p><p>Levana nodded, "I wear it every time that I go riding."</p><p>"I shall have to get you a new one then," Aemond said as he approached Levana, "the Red Keep is dull without you."</p><p>"Aemond," Levana smiled, "Dragonstone isn't as entertaining as I thought it would be."</p><p>The two let out a small laugh as they looked toward the sky. Immediately, Aemond followed the silhouette of a large figure that was flying through the skies. Levana's eyes widened at the realization that the figure was none other than her aunt's dragon.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana called, "I know what you're thinking," she whispered as the male began to walk down the steps.</p><p>"Don't do this, Aemond."</p><p>"You're free to come and stop me," Aemond smiled before rushing down the steps. Levana groaned as she followed after him.</p><p>There was trouble afoot.</p>

</p><p> </p><p>"Aemond!"</p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p>Levana trailed behind the blonde prince as he climbed the hill towards where Vhagar rested.</p><p>"You can't do this," Levana panted, "they're going to be angry at you!"</p><p>"If you're afraid, head back, Levana."</p><p>"Vhagar is my Aunt Laena's dragon," The princess huffed, "Rhaena is to be Vhagar's next rider."</p><p>Aemond turned to the princess and glared, "if you don't want to help me, Levana, go back."</p><p>"I don't want to leave you, Aemond," Levana stated as tumbled slightly, "I don't want you to go alone but this is still wrong."</p><p>The young prince turned to her and raised an eyebrow before taking a couple of steps back to help Levana up the hill, "you need to be more careful."</p><p>Aemond offered his arm to her which she took as they slowly made their way toward where Vhagar rested.</p><p>"Do you think she'll accept me as a rider?" Aemond asked as Levana smiled, "she will accept you, Aemond, just as Vermithor accepted me," she stated as they slowed their steps to gaze upon the large size of the dragon just inches away from them.</p><p>"Aemond, this is as far as I can go," Levana stated, "you will have to approach Vhagar alone."</p><p>The prince looked at her with a worried expression on his face to which Levana pinched his cheeks too, "the commands ar--"</p><p><em>"Serve,"</em> Aemond cut her off as the princess smiled, <em>"don't forget the command to calm her down, yes?" </em>she asked as the former nodded his head.</p><p><em>"The command for fly, as well," </em>Levana reminded, <em>"once you mount Vhagar, I'll summon Vermithor and follow you in the sky."</em></p><p>"You won't leave me, will you?" Aemond asked as Levana smiled, "I'll be by your side," she assured as the prince nodded and made his way to the dragon.</p><p>Levana watched intently as Aemond began to make his way toward the dragon. From where she was standing, she could see that he had his first attempts at approaching the dragon which Vhagar didn't seem too interested in him.</p><p>The princess' eyes widened as she saw Vhagar open her mouth; she could see the flames in her mouth beginning to form - it reminded her of when Vermithor did the same to her when he claimed him. She was about to shout to Aemond to get away but she heard the prince's loud commands of <em>serve</em>.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, Aemond had mounted the dragon and commanded it to fly. Levana watched excitedly as the prince began his first flight. She jumped up and down to wave at him before running down to the beach where Vermithor was laying at rest.</p><p>"Vermithor," Levana called as her dragon raised its head slightly before moving his position so that the young princess could mount him.</p><p><em>"Fly," </em>Levana commanded as Vermithor spread his wings and took to the skies, following after Vhagar. From a distance, the princess could see Aemond successfully getting on the saddle; she smiled at the achievement and watched in awe as the prince flew on the <em>largest </em>dragon in the world.</p><p>It was as if Aemond was destined to be on dragonback.</p><p><em>"Higher, Vermithor!" </em>Levana said as she patted her dragon who heeded her command to fly higher, just so they could keep up with Vhagar.</p><p>"Are you seeing this, Levana?" Aemond shouted, "yes, I can see you, Aemond!" she shouted back as Vermithor flew to the side of Vhagar.</p><p>
<b>
<em>"The world sees you, Aemond."</em>
</b>
</p><p>The assurance made the prince laugh in joy as they two continued their dance in the sky with their dragons. For a moment, everything seemed to be at peace. This was the first time that Levana had seen Aemond with such joy that it made her cry ever so slightly.</p><p>Maybe she was too young to understand the feeling in her heart but seeing Aemond in such a state of her joy made her happy as well.</p><p>After flying, the two dragons landed by the shore as the two children began their trek back into the High Tide stronghold. All the while, Aemond had a smile on his face and he was joking around with Levana - something that doesn't usually happen.</p><p>"It's him."</p><p>Levana looked in front of them to see her cousins, Rhaella and Baela with her younger brothers.</p><p>"It's me," Aemond's mood turned sour.</p><p>"Vhagar is my mother's dragon," Baela stated as Aemond took off his cloak and threw it to the side, "your mother's dead," he responded.</p><p>"Vhagar has a new rider now."</p><p>"She was mine to claim!" Rhaena interjected as Levana walked behind Aemond and placed a hand on his shoulder, "enough," she whispered but the male shrugged her hand off.</p><p>"Then you should've claimed her," Aemond responded, "maybe your cousins can find you a pig to ride."</p><p>"Aemond, stop it, now," Levana pleaded as Aemond shot her a smirk.</p><p>"It suits you," Aemond chuckled as Rhaena rushed towards him but the male was quick to push her aside. Baela followed suit and attacked the male with a punch, Levana tried to pull Aemond away from them but the male retaliated with a punch of his own to the Velaryon.</p><p>"Come at me again and I'll feed you to my dragon!" Aemond threatened as Levana rushed to Baela's side.</p><p>"Stop this at once!" Levana shouted but it fell on deaf ears as her younger brothers decided to join the brawl. Levana tried to stop her brothers from attacking Aemond but it was too late.</p><p>"Luke, Jace!" Levana scolded as Jace threw a punch at Aemond to which the older prince responded with a kick to his stomach. Lucerys rushed towards Aemond but was stopped, receiving a punch to the nose.</p><p>"Lucerys!" Levana said in a panic as she rushed towards her younger brother.</p><p>As she was tending to Lucerys, she didn't realize that Jacaerys had stood up and tackled Aemond to the ground. He, along with Rhaena and Baela began to attack Aemond who was on his back on the floor.</p><p>"Let me at him, Ana!" Lucerys growled as he stood up from his position and joined the group in attacking Aemond. Levana tried her best to break up the fight, pulling at her brothers' arms and then at her cousins' to try and get them away from Aemond.</p><p>After recovering, Aemond was quick to kick Jacaerys in the stomach and push the two girls away from him. He grabbed Lucerys by the neck and took a rock from the ground.</p><p>"Aemond, let my brother go!" Levana shouted as he ran to Aemond, tugging at his arm only to be harshly pushed away by the male, her back hitting the wall. Baela and Rhaena were quick to rush to Levana's side, checking if she had hit her head or if she had any concussion.</p><p>Aemond turned his attention back to the two boys, "You will die screaming in flames just as your father did!"</p><p>Levana's eyes widened.</p><p>"Bastards," Aemond continued as Levana's eyes turned to Jacaerys.</p><p>"My father's still alive!" Lucerys shouted back as Levana stood up with the help of Rhaena. She rushed towards Jacaerys and stepped in front of him, "don't go there, Aemond," she warned.</p><p>"And why not?" Aemond asked, "he doesn't know, does he, Lord Strong?" he continued, directing the question at Jacaerys who produced a blade from his side. He pushed Levana away just as Aemond had thrown Lucerys towards her.</p><p>"Are you okay, Luke?" Levana asked, looking at her brother's bloodied face.</p><p>Aemond had managed to gain the upper hand against Jacaerys and was ready to hit him with a rock when the latter threw some sand toward him. Gaining the upper hand, Lucerys pushed Levana away and attacked Aemond with Jacaerys' blade, slicing at his eye.</p><p>"Luke!" Levana shouted as she ran towards Aemond, "what have you done?!"</p><p>"Aemond," The princess called as she stayed by his side, "show me," she requested but Aemond would not yield. Levana would go back and forth between checking her siblings and cousins to checking Aemond.</p><p>The princess' dress was bloodied by the blood of her younger brothers and Aemond when the prince was holding her hand. All the while, Levana had begun to scratch her arm to quell her anxiety.</p><p>Her brothers and Aemond were still spouting curses at each other. Levana couldn't handle them anymore.</p><p>"Cease this at once!"</p><p>Levana turned to see Ser Westerling and members of the Kingsguard arrive to their aid. The knight was quick to rush to Levana's side to check if she had been injured in the brawl, "are you alright, princess?" The sworn protector asked as Levana turned to him in panic.</p><p>"Ser Westerling," Levana turned to the knight in tears, "please help him!"</p><p>The Lord Commander looked at the princess and knelt beside the both of them, "let me see, my prince," he asked Aemond turned to face him, his hand falling from his eye as Levana watched the older man move back a little.</p><p>"Gods be good." </p>

<p>Levana sat on the steps in front of her grandsire's seat as the maesters tended to her younger brothers and Aemond. She, Rhaena, and Baela received the least of the damage so the maesters were quick to tend to them.</p><p>"How could you allow such a thing to happen?" King Viserys questioned as Levana looked towards him. She was instructed, specifically, by Ser Westerling and her Grandsire to stay by his side - she was their <em>key witness, </em>as she heard Ser Cole say.</p><p>"I will have answers," The King stated.</p><p>"The princes' were supposed to be in bed, My King," Ser Westerling stated as King Viserys turned to him, "who had the watch?"</p><p>"The prince was attacked by his cousins, Your Grace," The Hand interjected as Levana's gaze went to the males who were discussing the matter.</p><p>"You had oaths to protect and defend my blood!" King Viserys scolded, "I'm very sorry, Your Grace," Ser Westerling looked down.</p><p>"The Kingsguard has never had to defend princes from princes, Your Grace," Ser Cole tried to explain but the King would not have it.</p><p>"That is no answer!"</p><p>Levana returned her attention to Aemond and his mother. She tried to listen in on their conversation as best she could but despite her enhanced hearing, Levana still couldn't hear much because of the other whispers in the hall. People were talking at once and it made it hard for her to single out one conversation from a dozen others.</p><p>"It will heal, will it not, maester?" Queen Alicent asked as the maester stayed focused on his task to suture the wound on Aemond's eyes.</p><p>"The flesh will heal," The maester informed, "but the eye is lost, Your Grace."</p><p>Levana's eyes widened as she looked upon her brothers. She began to scratch at her arms, the area on her forearm already becoming red because of her scratches when Ser Westerling leaned down and placed a hand on her shoulder, "best to have the maesters check on your arm as well, Princess."</p><p>The Velaryon princess nodded as she saw her grandparents rush down the stairs, "what is the meaning of this?" Lord Corlys questioned as Levana rushed to him, hugging his waist tightly.</p><p>"Rhaena, Baela, what happened?" Princess Rhaenys asked, "what happened?" she asked again as she embraced the two girls. Lord Corlys stood in front of Levana's younger brothers and studied the scene in front of him before looking toward Levana.</p><p>"What happened, little ocean?" Lord Corlys asked as he removed Levana's arms from his waist and knelt in front of her, inspecting her arms and sighing at the redness that had come upon them from the princess' scratching.</p><p>"Little moon, come, I need you by my side," King Viserys called for Levana who looked at her paternal grandfather who then nodded at her. As she made her way towards the King, her mother came rushing in towards her brothers.</p><p>"Who did this?" Rhaenyra asked.</p><p>"They attacked me!" Aemond responded loudly.</p><p>"He attacked Baela!" Jacaerys interjected.</p><p>"He broke Luke's nose!"</p><p>Levana would run towards her grandsire and stand by his side, covering her ears because of the argument taking place in the hall.</p><p>"Enough!" The King stated but the back and forth still continued.</p><p>"He was going to kill Jace!"</p><p>"I didn't do anything!"</p><p>"Enough!" King Viserys responded as Levana held onto her grandsire's arm tightly. The arguing was becoming overwhelming for her.</p><p>"It should be my son telling the tale!" Queen Alicent shouted.</p><p>"He called us--" Jacaerys was about to respond but was cut out by the King's loud shout, "silence!"</p><p>"... bastards..." Jacaerys managed to mutter before turning to their mother, "he called us bastards," he repeated in a hushed voice as Rhaenyra stood up and faced the crowd.</p><p>"Aemond," King Visersys called as he walked down the steps, Levana aiding him as he continued to speak, "I will have the truth about what happened."</p><p>"What else is there to hear?" Queen Alicent questioned, "your son has been maimed and her son is responsible."</p><p>"It was a regrettable accident," Rhaenyra spoke as her sons held onto her tightly.</p><p>"Accident?" The Queen said in disbelief, "Prince Lucerys brought a blade to the ambush!"</p><p>Levana bit her bottom lip as she held tighter on Viserys' arm.</p><p>"He meant to kill my son!" The Queen added as Rhaenyra shook her head in disbelief, "it was my sons who were attacked and forced to defend themselves!"</p><p>"Vile insults were levied against my sons," Rhaenyra added as King Viserys turned to her, "what insults?" He asked.</p><p>"The legitimacy of my sons' birth was put loudly into question," Princess Rhaenyra spoke as Levana looked at the floor.</p><p>"He called us bastards," Jacaerys said as Levana tugged on her Grandsire's sleeve. King Viserys turned to her and placed a hand on her head.</p><p>"Levana," King Visersys began, "my little moon, I will have the truth of what happened."</p><p>Levana shook her head, afraid that her mother might get mad at her, "tell me now."</p><p>"Aemond and I were out riding dragons," Levana began, "we had a confrontation because Aemond took Vhagar."</p><p>"Over a dragon?" King Visersys asked, "this brawl happened over a dragon?"</p><p>"Who attacked first?" Queen Alicent interrogated but Levana kept silent.</p><p>"You are asked a question, Princess Levana," Queen Alicent repeated but King Viserys shielded the princess with his hand, "I will be the one questioning my granddaughter, Alicent."</p><p>"My sons are in line to inherit the throne, Your Grace," Rhaenyra was quick to remove the attention from her daughter, "this is the highest of treasons."</p><p>The King turned to Levana once again, "is this true, Levana?"</p><p>"What insight could the princess possibly have?" Queen Alicent crossed her hands, "she is their sister, she'll obviously take their side."</p><p>"Alicent," King Viserys said sternly, "enough."</p><p>"Prince Aemond must be sharply questioned so we might learn where he heard such slanders," Rhaenyra said as Alicent looked at her in disbelief.</p><p>"Over an insult?" Queen Alicent asked, "my son has lost an eye!"</p><p>"Aemond, tell me, where did you hear this lie?" King Viserys inquired. Queen Alicent, as expected, tried to defend her son from further questioning. Levana looked towards her mother who gestured for her to go to her side but she was stopped by the King.</p><p>"Where is Ser Laenor, I wonder? The boy's father?" Queen Alicent questioned, "perhaps he would provide some insight into the matter."</p><p>Rhaenyra shook her head, "I don't know, Your Grace," she responded, "I couldn't find sleep and I had gone out for a walk."</p><p>"Entertaining his young squires, I would venture," Queen Alicent remarked as Levana watched some of the people inside the hall chuckle and murmur about the comment. The fact that her brothers' birth has been questioned was one thing but to question her father was definitely another.</p><p>"With all due respect, my father has done nothing wrong to you, Your Grace," Levana spat, "what my father does in his own time is none of your business," she tried to remain as respectful as possible. Queen Alicent bore a look of shock on her face as King Viserys looked at his granddaughter with a stern expression.</p><p>"I will not allow anyone to sully my father's name or my mother's name," Levana stood her ground, "I may be young but I've been raised well."</p><p>"I tried my best to stop the brawl, really, I did," Levana explained, "but everyone was pushing and fighting," she continued.</p><p>"Everyone, including myself, participated in the brawl," Levana explained, "Aemond was fighting too and we all did what we had to do to defend ourselves," she added, "he was going to strike my brothers with a rock and so Jace had to retaliate."</p><p>Levana was scratching her arm profusely, the scratching had begun to draw blood. Aemond hopped off his chair and walked towards her, taking her hand to stop her from scratching. Levana looked at him in thanks as he began to gently pat down on the female's skin to ease the pain. The King looked at them and turned to Aemond, "where did you hear such lies?"</p><p>Aemond thought for a while, "Aegon."</p><p>"Me?" Aegon asked, shocked.</p><p>"And you, boy?" King Viserys approached him, "where did you hear such calumnies?"</p><p>Aegon was quiet, a response that King Viserys did not think good of, "Aegon! Tell me the truth about it!" He shouted as the prince took a deep breath.</p><p>"We know, father," Aegon finally spoke, "everyone knows," he continued before looking towards the Velaryon princes, "just look at them."</p><p>"Levana is the only one who looks like her father and us," Aegon added as Levana looked at him before stepping away from Aemond and walking towards her grandmother, Rhaenys who wrapped an arm around her protectively.</p><p>King Viserys examined them one by one, "this interminable fighting must cease!" he exclaimed, "all of you!"</p><p>"We are family!" King Viserys reminded, "now, make your apologies and show goodwill to one another," he stopped.</p><p>"Your father, your grandsire, <b>your king</b> demands it!" King Viserys shouted as Levana hid her face on Rhaenys' shoulder, "it's alright, Levana, I have you," the older princess whispered to her.</p><p>There was silence as the King made his way back to his seat. Alicent turned to him with tears in her eyes, "that is insufficient."</p><p>"Aemond has been damaged permanently, my King," The Queen gestured towards her son, "goodwill cannot make him whole!"</p><p>"I know, Alicent," The King sighed, "but I cannot restore his eye."</p><p>"No, because it's been taken," Queen Alicent stated, "what would you have me do?" King Viserys questioned.</p><p>"There is a debt to be paid," The Queen took a deep breath before turning to Rhaenyra, "I shall have one of her son's eyes in return."</p><p>Upon hearing the Queen's remark, Levana turned to her mother and ran in front of her and her younger brothers - attempting to shield them from what was about to come.</p><p>"My dear wife," King Viserys breathed but the Queen would not have it.</p><p>"He's your son, Viserys," Queen Alicent pointed out, "your blood," she added. Her last remark made Levana glare at her - all the talk of blood and birth irked her to no end.</p><p>"Do not allow your temper to guide your judgment," Said King Viserys as he approached his wife, "if the King will not seek justice," the Queen took a deep breath.</p><p>"The Queen will," Alicent continued before addressing Ser Cole, "Ser Criston, bring me the eye of Lucerys Velaryon."</p><p>Levana could see the knight's eyes widen at the instruction as Lucerys ran behind Lord Corlys who attempted to shield his grandson from view.</p><p>"I'll protect you, Luke," Levana promised as she walked to Lord Corlys' side.</p><p>"He can choose which eye to keep, a privilege he did not grant to my son," Queen Alicent said as Rhaenyra shook her head, "you will do no such thing."</p><p>"Stay your hand," instructed King Viserys.</p><p>"No!" Queen Alicent shouted, "you are sworn to me!" she recalled as the knight shifted in his position, "as your protector, My Queen," Ser Cole responded as the King looked towards Alicent with a look of disapproval.</p><p>"Alicent," King Viserys said sternly, "this matter is finished, do you understand?"</p><p>The Queen remained silent as King Viserys turned to address the crowd that assembled in the hall, "and let it be known that anyone whose tongue dares to question the birth and claim of Princess Rhaenyra's children should have it removed."</p><p>"Thank you, father," Princess Rhaenyra sighed as she turned to her children.</p><p>"Queen Alicent!" Levana shouted as the Queen took a knife from King Viserys and charged toward them. Rhaenyra was quick to grab Alicent's hands to prevent her from getting closer to her children. The Princess pushed the Queen to the center of the room and away from her children as Lucerys screamed loudly. Levana tried her best to shield her younger brother. Ser Westerling hurried to get in front of them to protect them as the two females conversed.</p><p>"Alicent, let her go!" King Viserys shouted but the Queen continued to rant.</p><p>"Release the blade, Alicent," The Hand ordered.</p><p>"Now they see you as you are," Was the only thing that Levana heard from her mother before the latter was pushed away by the Queen. Lord Corlys was quick to grab hold of Rhaenyra to prevent her from falling.</p><p>"Mother," Levana called, "blood..."</p><p>The crowd's attention turned to Princess Rhaenyra's bleeding arm as Aemond walked closer to them.</p><p>"Do not mourn me, mother," Aemond said, "I may have lost an eye but I gained a dragon."</p><p>"This preceding is at an end," King Viserys said in finality as he walked away from them.</p><p>Levana stepped in front of her mother as Aemond walked towards his own, embracing her.</p><p>For the first time in her life, Levana saw the division that she has heard from many about their family. The Greens and the Blacks were often referred to.</p><p>Levana looked at Aemond with a sad expression as the male looked away from her.</p><p>Just who is right and who is wrong? </p>

<p>The King's Hand, Otto Hightower, had gone to the Queen's chambers to meet his daughter. The sight he saw was one that he expected - his daughter, half crazy and standing in front of the fireplace.</p><p>The discussion that went between them was interrupted by a silence that you could cut through with a knife.</p><p>"What I did was an ugly thing and I regret it," Queen Alicent finally spoke.</p><p>"We play an ugly game," Otto stated, "and now, for the first time, I see that you have the determination to win it."</p><p>"What would you have me do?" Queen Alicent asked as her father walked closer to her, "I have a proposal, one that will benefit us in the long run," he stated as the female raised a brow in confusion.</p><p>"One that you might not enjoy," Otto added, "will you let me hear it before you make assumptions, father?" Queen Alicent asked as The Hand took a deep breath.</p><p>"Wed Aemond to Levana Velaryon."</p><p>Queen Alicent laughed, "perhaps I am not the one who is mad here."</p><p>"It will give us the upper hand, Alicent," Otto began, "if Levana is wed to Aemond then that is something that we can use to our advantage."</p><p>"Rhaenyra will never allow it."</p><p>"And yet she proposed that Jacaerys marry Helaena, if I remember rightly?" Otto asked as he placed his hands behind his back, "Princess Rhaenyra will hesitate further advances towards us if Levana is wed to Aemond."</p><p>"Both of them also ride the largest dragons alive," Otto added, "that rogue Aemond in winning Vhagar to our side was indeed worth a thousand times the price he paid and if he is married to Levana, <b>we will be formidable</b>."</p><p>Queen Alicent thought for a while, "I suppose there is no better match for Aemond than Levana," she chuckled; willfully ignoring her father's comment about the dragons that the children rode, "even as younger children, they were very fond of each other."</p><p>"I will bring it up with the King," Queen Alicent stayed, "but he is yet to forgive me."</p><p>"He will forgive you," Otto assured, "what else can he do?"</p><p>"I injured his daughter."</p><p>Otto held Alicent's shoulders, "go to him," he instructed, "be penitent, plead the injury to your son, and keep a grip on your passions."</p><p>Alicent nodded.</p><p>"I promise you, in time, you and I together will prevail."</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana stood beside her younger brothers as their mother's arm was getting stitched by the maester. She placed a hand on Lucerys' head, patting him as Jacaerys leaned onto her shoulder.</p><p>It was silent, except for the grunts of their mother as the needle penetrated her skin.</p><p>"It will scar but the wound will heal," The maester finally said, "Valyrian steel cuts clean."</p><p>Just as the maester spoke, their father entered the room with an unreadable expression.</p><p>"Gods," Laenor finally spoke, "is everyone alright?"</p><p>"A broken nose is the worst," The maester responded, "Princess Levana will have to be given an ointment for her scratches," he added.</p><p>"Thank you maester," Rhaenyra said, "leave us," she requested as the maester gathered his materials and bowed before leaving the family.</p><p>Rhaenyra turned to Levana and her brothers with a sign, "you three as well," she stated, "you've already found enough trouble today."</p><p>"Yes, mother," Levana responded as she took her brothers by the hand and walked towards the door.</p><p>"Levana, stay as far away from this room as possible," Rhaenyra stated as the princess hung her head low before nodding and leaving with her brothers, closing the door behind them.</p><p>"Why did mother say that to you?" Jacaerys asked as Levana took a deep breath as they continued to walk through the halls, "I can hear many things, Jace," she responded.</p><p>"Sometimes the things that I hear are not nice," Levana said as she pushed open the doors to her chambers, letting her brothers in before closing the door behind them.</p><p>"Do you ever tell mother about them?" Lucerys asked as Levana nodded, "that's why she told me to be as far from their chambers as possible."</p><p>There was silence between the three of them for a while before Jacaerys asked, "Levana, why did you help Aemond steal Vhagar?"</p><p>Levana was taken aback by the question, "I didn't help him."</p><p>"But you were riding with him on Vermithor!" Jacaerys exclaimed, "Rhaena was supposed to claim Vhagar!"</p><p>Levana took a seat on her bed and sighed, "we cannot do anything about it anymore, Jace," she held her hands up in defeat, "let it go."</p><p>"Why do you like Aemond so much?" Lucerys asked, "is it because you look more like them than us?"</p><p>The question made Levana's eyes widen in shock, she was quick to embrace her younger brother, "never say that again," she said.</p><p>"You, Jacaerys, and Joffrey, are my brothers," Levana assured, "no matter what we look like and no matter what people say," she added as she placed a kiss on top of Lucerys head and gestured for Jacaerys to join in their embrace. The older prince sighed and embraced the both of them.</p><p>"I will always be your sister," Levana said, "that is a promise."</p><p>"Even when you're married?" Lucerys asked as Levana chuckled in response, "I dare not think of marriage yet, Luke."</p><p>"What Lord would be in the right mind to marry me?" Levana looked at her brothers and smiled, "the mere sight of Vermithor will scare all of them away."</p><p>Jacaerys looked at her with a sad expression, "if you do get married, you'll have to go away."</p><p>"Then I wouldn't mind staying unmarried so that my brothers won't be sad to see me leave," Levana responded as the two boys began to lighten up and smile.</p><p>"Then you'll end up old and alone," Lucerys teased as the female laughed, "I do not mind as long as I would see my brothers grow and become strong warriors," she smiled, "great Lords and Kings."</p><p>Lucerys looked down, "do you really believe that I'll make everyone proud as Lord of Driftmark, Ana?"</p><p>"Luke," Levana smiled, "you are the grandson of King Viserys and Lord Corlys, both are great rulers," she recalled, "I have no doubt in my mind that you will be as great as them, Lucerys."</p><p>"And you'll be a great Queen!" Jacaerys smiled, "just like mother!"</p><p>"I do hope so," Levana's smile curved downward ever so slightly, "I don't want to disappoint mother."</p>

</p><p> </p><p>"You called for me, mother?"</p><p>Levana bowed her head as she walked into her mother's chambers, she greeted her parents with kisses on their cheeks before standing in front of them with a smile. Laenor looked at Rhaenyra before taking a deep breath and walking towards the younger princess, kneeling down to meet her height before taking her hand in his.</p><p>"My little princess, remind me again how young you are?" Laenor asked as Levana furrowed her eyebrows.</p><p>"I will be ten on the next harvest moon, father," Levana smiled, "you're supposed to be keeping track of my age too, father."</p><p>Laenor chuckled, "maybe I just needed you to remind me," he pinched her cheek as Rhaenyra smiled.</p><p>"Levana," Rhaenyra finally spoke, "the reason that you have been summoned here is because of a matter that you must hear from your father and I."</p><p><em>"Am I in trouble?" </em>Levana asked, <em>"I already made amends with my brothers, Aemond, Rhaena, and Baela."</em></p><p>Rhaenyra looked at her daughter with an amused smile, "Queen Alicent and your Grandsire came to your father and I with a proposition," Rhaenyra began, "one that we have accepted."</p><p>Levana all but understood what her mother was trying to tell her but her father would stand up from his seat to kneel in front of his daughter, holding her hand in his.</p><p>"You are nearly of age, Levana," Laenor sighed, "and when women come of age, they will be asked to marry."</p><p>"You will soon be of age to accept suitors," Laenor continued, "it's just about the time that Lords from across the seven realms offer their sons for your hand."</p><p>"Just like your father and I," Rhaenyra added as Levana shook her head in disagreement.</p><p>"Mother," Levana muttered, "I don't understand," she stepped away from her father, "I thought that it was alright with you that I wouldn't be married?"</p><p>Rhaenyra and Laenor looked at each other before the former walked toward Levana and embraced her.</p><p>"Levana," Rhaenyra knelt to face her daughter, "think of our family," she placed a hand on her cheek.</p><p><em>"You will be the one to bring our families together," </em>Rhaenyra smiled, <em>"you will be the link to prevent fighting between our family and Queen's."</em></p><p><em>"I'm afraid," </em>Levana confessed, <em>"I don't want to marry just anyone."</em></p><p>Rhaenyra shook her head, "your father and I made sure that you will marry someone that you would want to marry."</p><p>"How do you know that, mother?" Levana asked, "I don't even know what marriage means."</p><p>"That's why you have until you are ten and three," Rhaenyra stated, "at least, that's the age that I have managed to bargain for."</p><p>Levana realized quickly that she had no choice in the matter and resigned to nodding her head.</p><p>"Who am I to wed?" Levana asked her parents as Laenor pursed his lips and held out his hand, "we'll see them off."</p><p>"Please assure me that it's not Aegon," Levana whined, "I'd rather marry a pig."</p><p>Rhaenyra chuckled as Levana took Laenor's hand before walking off to the Grand Hall of Driftmark Castle. Princess Rhaenys stood beside Lord Corlys who was opposite the King and the Queen; Levana looked around to see Aemond standing beside his mother.</p><p>Sadness and pity immediately enveloped Levana's heart as she looked at Aemond. The male smiled at her slightly as Laenor knelt in front of her again before looking over at Aemond.</p><p>"It's him?" Levana turned to Ser Laenor who nodded his head, Rhaenyra smiled at her daughter and wrapped an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>"It's me," Aemond chuckled as Levana rolled her eyes. The encounter from the night before replayed briefly in her mind as he held out his hand, waiting for the princess to take it.</p><p>"I firmly believe that there is no better match for Aemond than you, Princess Levana Velaryon," Queen Alicent stated as she smiled slightly at Rhaenyra who nodded at the statement.</p><p>King Viserys smiled, "you two will make for a fine match," he commented before nodding to his daughter and motioning to leave the room. Levana thought for a while, looking over at her mother and then at Aemond who still had his hand outstretched.</p><p>Levana took Aemond's hand, the latter bringing it to his lips to place a small kiss on her knuckles.</p><p>"We shall expect Princess Levana at King's Landing on the next Harvest Moon," Queen Alicent stated as she bowed her head slightly to acknowledge Rhaenyra and Laenor before gesturing for the King to step out of the room.</p><p>"My next Name Day?" Levana asked as Aemond held her hand in his, pulling her out of the Hall of Nine and to the stables where their carriages awaited to bring them to the ships.</p><p>"You will come to King's Landing soon, right?" Aemond asked as Levana looked over her shoulder to see her father nodding at her. She, in turn, gave the prince a smile and a nod.</p><p>"On my next Name Day," Levana began, "I will come to King's Landing," she assured as the male enveloped her in a tight embrace - earning shocked reactions from those around them.</p><p>"Aemond, that's enough," Queen Alicent stated as Aemond slowly let go of Levana.</p><p>"It will be lonely without you," Aemond admitted as the princess chuckled, "you're such a babe."</p><p>Prince Aemond chuckled before Ser Cole walked to his side, "time to go, Your Grace."</p><p>Levana rolled her eyes before walking to stand beside her father, she waved Aemond off as he boarded the carriage. She watched them as the carriages left the castle and before her father could get another word, Levana rushed out of the stronghold and ran towards the shore where Vermithor was resting.</p><p><em>"Vermithor, let's see them off," </em>Levana stated as she mounted her dragon, the large beast let out a grumble before spreading its wings and taking flight. Laenor watched with an amused expression as he watched his daughter fly off on one of the largest dragons in the realm.</p><p>Once the carriages reached the boats, Vermithor and Levana stayed in the air as they boarded. The princess watched as her Grandsire boarded the boat followed by her betrothed who waved at her. Levana didn't know if he could see her from the air but she waved back - rather enthusiastically as the boats began to sail away from Driftmark.</p><p>Soon, Sunfyre and Dreamfyre would follow; each letting out loud roars as they passed Vermithor. Vhagar would soon follow after them, bellowing as she soared past Vermithor. Levana would watch as the ships sailed away before heading back to the castle.</p><p>As she flew over Driftmark, she saw her mother with Daemon. Levana raised an eyebrow but paid no attention to it as Vermithor landed on the shore. The young princess unmounted from her dragon and stroked his neck. She leaned her forehead against the dragon who bellowed in response.</p><p>Levana began her trek back to the castle, she took a deep breath as she looked toward the sea. She was at peace like this; watching the waves crash against the shore and the smell of the sea made her feel at home.</p><p>Ser Laenor waved at her from the entrance of the castle, "my beloved, I do request that you do not run off to fly without asking permission," he said as Levana wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>"Alright," Laenor chuckled, "I can never stay mad at you for too long."</p><p>Levana smiled as she held her father's hand, the male led her inside the castle as the female walked beside him.</p><p>"Father," Levana called as Laenor looked down at her, "yes, little one?"</p><p>"Will you be at my wedding?" Levana asked, "I don't want to get married without you or mother," she continued as Ser Laenor smiled at her.</p><p>"I wouldn't miss it for the world, little one," Laenor promised, "we will be at your wedding and we will see to it that you will have the grandest one in the realm."</p><p>Levana smiled, "thank you, father."</p><p>"For you, my little princess," Laenor smiled, "anything."</p>

<p>"Levana, you should be asleep," Laenor stated as he walked inside his daughter's room, the princess could only chuckle as she set her book aside and walked towards her bed. The knight walked up to the bed and sat on it, ensuring that his daughter would be settled in before she retired for the night.</p><p>"I was reading about dragons," Levana smiled, "wouldn't it be nice if I got to ride Balerion the Black Dread?"</p><p>Laenor chuckled, "I have no doubt that you would make an exemplary rider, Levana."</p><p>"Grandsire got to ride Balerion," Levana began, "it's unfortunate that I never got to see him."</p><p>"But you have Vermithor," Laenor stated, "and your betrothed has Vhagar," he continued as Levana adjusted her sheets.</p><p>"You and Prince Aemond ride the two largest dragons," Laenor reminded her, "once you two learn to fly properly, you will be formidable."</p><p>Levana smiled as Laenor tucked her in, kissing her forehead as he went to fix the books that she had left on her table. His eyes wandered to the ring on his finger that once belonged to his lover as he looked at his daughter in the mirror.</p><p>"Levana," Laenor called as he returned to her side and took her hand in his, "you know that I love you, yes?"</p><p>The princess nodded, "you always told me that you loved me and that you were immensely proud of me even if I get in trouble most times."</p><p>Laenor chuckled as he removed the ring from his finger and held it up for his daughter to see, "this ring is very important to me and it once belonged to someone very close to my heart," he began as he held Levana's hand and slipped the ring on her finger, "I give it to you."</p><p>Levana looked at the ring and smiled, she had never seen a piece of jewelry that was as beautiful as it.</p><p>"This way," Laenor smiled, "you will have a piece of me wherever you go."</p><p>The princess sat up from her bed to hug her father. Laenor held back tears as he embraced her, "you grow up so fast."</p><p>"Maybe tomorrow," Levana smiled, "I'll be as tall as you!"</p><p>Ser Laenor chuckled as he slowly let go of his daughter, kissing her forehead as he walked towards the doors of her chamber.</p><p>"I love you, Levana."</p><p>"I love you too, father," Levana smiled, "I'll see you in the morning."</p><p>Laenor looked at her with a small smile before nodding. He blew out the candle by Levana's door before making his way toward his chambers. A million thoughts went through his head as he looked back at his daughter's door only to continue walking away.</p><p>It was going to be a long night.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana awoke to the rapid steps of people running past her room. She looked out her window to see that the sun had just begun to rise. She climbed down from her bed and rubbed her eyes to help her wake up.</p><p>The princess wore her shoes as she made her way out of her room. She looked around to see that the servants were frantic. No one had bothered to greet her as they made their way to the Hall of Nine; Levana, seeing as no one was stopping her, headed for the hall as well.</p><p>As she neared the hall, she could hear shouting and screaming from who she could identify as her grandmother. Levana could feel her heart beating loudly as she carefully made her way down the steps.</p><p>Princess Rhaenys was screaming and crying as Lord Corlys scolded his guards. Not one of them bothered to notice the little princess who managed to walk past all the servants and the guards to see the sight in front of her.</p><p>Levana's eyes grew wide as she saw her grandmother kneeling on the floor, "grandmother?" she called as Rhaenys turned her head. The older princess was quick to wrap her arms around the little princess, blocking her view of the scene in front of her.</p><p>"Grandmother, what's happening?" Levana asked as Rhaenys shook her head, "don't look, little one."</p><p>Levana wouldn't have it. She tried to remove herself from Rhaenys' grasp only to be held by Lord Corlys.</p><p>"Don't look, little ocean," Lord Corlys whispered as he carried Levana, escorting her out of the room.</p><p>"What happened, Grandsire?" Levana asked as he tried to look over Lord Corlys' shoulder, she could make out a burnt body on the floor in what she recognized as her father's clothes.</p><p>"What happened to my father?" Levana asked as she tried to escape from Lord Corlys' grasp, "what happened to my father?!"</p><p>The princess managed to jump out of her Grandsire's arms before making a beeline back to the Hall of Nine where Princess Rhaenys knelt beside the body of whom Levana finally recognized as her father. The princess' knees grew weak as she saw what her father had become; Princess Rhaenys wrapped her arms tightly around her as she began to sob.</p><p>"That's not my father," Levana muttered as she buried her face into Rhaenys' arm, "my father is still alive," she tried to convince herself but the Princess Rhaenys could only do so much to comfort her granddaughter who soon became a sobbing mess.</p><p>"I want my father!" Levana shouted as Lord Corlys rushed back to her and carried her in his arms.</p><p>"My Lord," one of the knights called as Lord Corlys nodded towards him, "Princess Rhaenyra, Prince Daemon, and the children are nowhere to be found," the knight whispered but Levana heard him. She lifted her head slightly as she looked at the knight, "my mother is gone?"</p><p>"Has my mother abandoned me, Grandsire?" Levana asked as Lord Corlys shook his head, "we will have the truth of this, Levana," he promised as he opened the door to the princess's chambers.</p><p>"For now, you will need to rest," Lord Corlys gently placed the princess back in her bed, "your grandmother and I will discuss what will happen from here."</p><p>Lord Corlys placed a kiss on top of her head before leaving the room. Levana, still in a state of shock, sat in her bed with her knees to her chest. She was quickly understanding the situation now.</p><p>Her father was dead.</p><p>Her mother was nowhere to be found.</p><p>For the first time in her life, Levana felt that she was truly alone. She was trying to make out possible reasons why her mother would <em>abandon </em>her in High Tide.</p><p>While there were questions better left unanswered, Levana wanted answers to hers.</p>

<p>Weeks after the loss of her father, Levana spent most of her time with Vermithor at the beach. While she spent most of her life in the Red Keep and King's Landing, she always found solace near the ocean. Maybe it was her Velaryon blood or her father always made it a point to bring her to the ocean whenever they flew to Driftmark.</p><p>The princess leaned her back against Vermithor as she watched Seasmoke from the distance. The dragon had lost his rider and spent most of his time keeping his distance from others - but he never felt threatened by Vermithor and Levana's presence. In fact, Levana thought that Seasmoke enjoyed their company.</p><p>"Levana!"</p><p>Levana turned her head to see her grandmother walking toward her. She got up from the sand and gave her dragon a couple of strokes before walking towards Princess Rhaenys and embracing her.</p><p>"A raven came from your mother," Princess Rhaenys began, "she's with Daemon in Dragonstone with your cousins and siblings."</p><p>Levana felt her heart sink. It seems that her mother and Daemon managed to haul all of her siblings as well as Rhaena and Baela to Dragonstone but did not bother for her.</p><p>"She is asking for you," Princess Rhaenys stated, "your Grandsire is arranging an escort for you to Dragonstone."</p><p>Levana looked at Vermithor and shook her head, "I don't want to go."</p><p>"Levana," Rhaenys sighed, "I know how close you are to your father and the loss is too much for you but being with your remaining family will be for the best."</p><p>"You and Grandsire are family," Levana reminded, "can't I stay at Driftmark?"</p><p>Rhaenys sighed, "being with your mother will be better and your brothers need you."</p><p>Levana shook her head, "I won't go to Dragonstone," she said firmly, "my mother didn't even bother to take me with her in the first place."</p><p>Princess Rhaenys sighed, "your ship leaves in the mourn."</p><p>Levana watched as Princess Rhaenys began to walk away. She thought for a bit before catching up with her, "grandmother, I have a request."</p><p>"Anything, Levana," Rhaenys replied as Levana smiled. The older female furrowed her brows a bit, "I'm not going to enjoy this request, am I?" She asked as the little girl nodded sheepishly.</p><p>"Let's hear it then."</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Lord Corlys looked at his wife from his seat and sighed, "do you know why she would think of requesting such a thing?"</p><p>Rhaenys shook her head as she looked into the fire, "you aren't planning on humoring her with the request are you, Lord Husband?"</p><p>The male thought for a while, "You know our granddaughter, she would never ask for anything unless she has a plan," he stated as Rhaenys chuckled.</p><p>"Such a conniving mind," Rhaenys said in amusement, "she's not even ten."</p><p>The Lord of the Tides chuckled as well before turning his attention to the fire, "I pity her," he began, "she need not see what became of her father."</p><p>"Laenor loved Levana," Rhaenys sighed, "they were inseparable," she continued before turning her head to face her husband.</p><p>"Yes," Corlys began, "I have half the mind to grant Levana's request," he revealed as Rhaenys chuckled in response.</p><p>"I had no doubt that you would," The princess stated, "you and Laenor had a bad habit of spoiling her."</p><p>The two laughed at the statement before Rhaenys sighed, "she's too young to make such a decision herself," she stated as Lord Corlys nodded, "but she has already made her choice."</p><p>"She came with a strong and valid argument," Corlys began, "we must also honor it."</p><p>"Regardless, Levana isn't even ten yet," Rhaenys interjected, "I fear that she may be too young to know what she wants."</p><p>Lord Corlys looked at his lap and sighed, "and yet she rides the Bronze Fury at this age."</p><p>"That bears no connection to the matter at hand," Rhaenys rolled her eyes before looking back at the fire and sighing.</p><p>"We are her grandparents," Rhaenys stated, "we cannot grant her requests as we are not her parents."</p><p>"But she was left in our care, Rhaenys," Lord Corlys pointed out, "and Levana made the decision herself and if such is her request, I am obliged to grant it."</p><p>"You are not obliged to grant anything," Rhaenys said, "you just want to further spoil your granddaughter."</p><p>"What do you think our son would do?"</p><p>Rhaenys rolled her eyes, "need I respond, Corlys?"</p><p>Lord Corlys nodded as his Lady Wife sighed, "he would grant the request because Levana has her reasons," she said as the Lord of the Tides nodded his head.</p><p>"I am left with no choice," Princess Rhaenys sighed, "I'll be part of her escort."</p><p>"You think that wise, Rhaenys?" Lord Corlys asked, "I refuse to let my granddaughter go alone," the princess responded.</p><p>"She's already suffered much of that in the few weeks that she's lost her father," Rhaenys began, "the same few weeks that her mother is wallowing in Dragonstone with Daemon Targaryen of all people."</p><p>"Do you blame Rhaenyra for our son's death?" Lord Corlys asked as his wife looked at him plainly, "do you think she has nothing to do with it?" She returned the question as the Lord of Driftmark pursed his lips.</p><p>For a moment, there was silence between the two. The cracking from the fire was the only thing that can be heard in the hall aside from the sound of the distant and slow crashing of the waves outside the castle.</p><p>"I will see to it that the Princess is packed and ready to leave by dawn," Rhaenys said as she stood up from her seat only to be stopped by Lord Corlys who held her hand in his.</p><p>"You tell Laenor and I that we spoil the princess and yet you are willing to escort her on her travels," Lord Corlys chuckled as Rhaenys smiled.</p><p>"She is the only memory of Laenor that I have left," Rhaenys looked at her husband with a sad smile, "gods be damned that I let that little girl go anywhere alone." </p>

<p>The walk to Princess Levana's room seemed long though it was just a few steps from her own chambers. Rhaenys thought of ways on how she could further help her grandchild adjust to the recent events of her life but she could only do so much to help Levana — especially when the younger princess leaves Driftmark and they would be a sea apart.</p><p>"Levana," Princess Rhaenys called from the other side of the door. She could hear muffling and the sound of something being knocked over to which she raised a brow.</p><p>"Come in, grandmother!"</p><p>Rhaenys opened the door no second later to see that the younger princess had managed to topple over one of her luggage, the clothes spilling out of it. The older female could do nothing but chuckle in amusement as she walked to Levana who was trying to shove her dresses back inside the carrier.</p><p>"That will not do," Rhaenys said as she knelt on the floor beside her granddaughter to help her pick up the dresses. She sat on Levana's bed and began to fold them as the latter watched.</p><p>"Did your handmaidens not help you?" Rhaenys asked as Levana looked at the floor, "it's getting late and I didn't want to disturb them anymore," she responded as the former smiled.</p><p>Levana was always a thoughtful child. She would think about those around her before she would think of herself. It was a trait that Rhaenys always thought admirable but also one that she was not particularly fond of as she saw her granddaughter too kind.</p><p>"Are you ready for your journey?"</p><p>Levana thought for a while, "as I'll ever be."</p><p>"Are you certain that you want to go?" Rhaenys asked, "you can stay with your Grandsire and I here in Driftmark," she offered as Levana smiled and sat beside her. The younger princess leaned her head on Rhaenys' shoulder and reached out for her grandmother's hand to take it in her own.</p><p>"Levana, I do not wish to see you go," Rhaenys sighed, "but if this is what you wish, I will grant it."</p><p>"Do you hate my mother?" Levana asked. Princess Rhaenys was taken aback by the question but smiled at her granddaughter before kissing her forehead, "I hate the fact that you are ignoring my question more."</p><p>Levana giggled as she embraced her grandmother tightly, "I'll miss you."</p><p>"We will send ravens to each other," Rhaenys promised, "just as we did when you were much younger."</p><p>"But I promise that my letters will make much more sense now," Levana promised as Rhaenys smiled and patted her head.</p><p>Once Levana's garments were packed and her bags were carried off by the soldiers to the ship, Rhaenys found herself tucking in the young princess; making sure that she was comfortable. It had been her routine to do so ever since Laenor's death. Rhaenys wanted to ensure that the princess still felt loved despite all that had happened in a span of weeks.</p><p>"Can I fly on Vermithor when we leave tomorrow?"</p><p>Rhaenys thought for a while before tucking in the princess' blanket around her body, "alright but only if you promise to stay close to Meleys and I."</p><p>Levana nodded in excitement as Rhaenys kissed her forehead, "good night, little one."</p><p>As Rhaenys left the room, Levana turned towards the window in her room; she stared at it for a while as she sighed, not knowing what tomorrow would look like for her. She's spent most of her days with Vermithor and others in the comforts of her library - never did she imagine leaving Driftmark or her grandparents who had made sure that she lived comfortably in the weeks that her parents were gone.</p><p>With a small sigh, Levana closed her eyes, trying her best to find sleep. She was excited for dawn to arrive just as she was excited to begin a new day.</p><p> </p><p>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"Have the ravens been sent?" Rhaenys asked as Corlys nodded, "the ravens should arrive before you do," he stated as the princess nodded.</p><p>"It will be dawn soon," Corlys sighed, "you should rest."</p><p>Rhaenys shook her head, "I'll rest on the trip back to Driftmark," she said as she leaned her head against her chair, "I don't think I'll be able to sleep in this condition."</p><p>"Is it because of nervousness or is it because you still think Levana's choice to be wrong?" Lord Corlys asked as Princess Rhaenys rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Whether or not I think of her decision as wrong doesn't matter anymore," Rhaenys responded, "she's already leaving Driftmark in the mourn."</p><p>"My Lady Wife," Lord Corlys began, "I hope you do not hold this against me."</p><p>"Corlys," Rhaenys sighed, "there are many other matters that I would like to hold against you, and yet I did not," she stated as her Lord Husband chuckled a response.</p><p>"Just as you said, Levana has made this decision on her own," Rhaenys continued, "we have no choice but to honor the wishes of the young princess."</p><p>"I just hope that Levana knows what she's doing," Lord Corlys chuckled.</p><p>"Levana is a smart girl," Rhaenys smiled, "I'm sure she'll manage."</p><p>From the top of the grand staircase of the Hall of Nine, Levana listened in on her grandparents; unable to find sleep. At the very least, it warmed her heart to know that she would have their support no matter the circumstance.</p><p>"Good night Grandsire, grandmother," Levana whispered as she slowly walked back to her room.</p><p>Dawn couldn't come any sooner.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Dawn arrived quicker than anyone anticipated. Levana would be in the riding gear that Lord Corlys gifted to her. The garment was gold with accents of red and black, but what was unique about her garments were the buttons and the cufflinks — they have adorned with the Velaryon and Targaryen sigil as a symbol of the two houses that the princess hails from.</p><p>"It fits like a glove," Lord Corlys commented as Levana excitedly twirled in her riding gear. This would be her first time wearing it.</p><p>"Thank you, Grandsire!" Levana said as she embraced Lord Corlys who smiled in response. Princess Rhaenys would soon emerge from the castle in her own riding gear; Levana looked at her grandmother in awe. While this was not the first that she had seen the older princess in her riding gear, there was just something about her grandmother that exuded the aura of power.</p><p>Rhaenys paused and looked at her granddaughter with a soft expression.</p><p>"Are you alright, grandmother?" Levana asked as Rhaenys nodded with a small smile.</p><p>"It's just," the older princess sighed, "you look so much like your father in those robes."</p><p>Levana smiled widely, "then I must be beautiful because my father was very handsome!"</p><p>"Are you ready to go, little one?" Rhaenys asked as her granddaughter nodded enthusiastically. Lord Corlys gave the signal for the small fleet that he had assembled to begin its course while the two princesses headed for the shores where Meleys and Vermithor waited.</p><p>Just as Levana was about to mount Vermithor, she heard a loud roar from the distance. She recognized the sound to be from Seasmoke who emerged from the mountains. Levana smiled slightly at the sight as she waved a farewell to her father's dragon.</p><p>"Time to go."</p><p>Levana turned to her grandmother who had already mounted Meleys. She nodded as Vermithor leaned down so the young princess could climb onto him. With a sigh, Levana mounted her dragon and nodded at her grandmother.</p><p>
<em>"Fly."</em>
</p><p>Meleys was first to take to the skies, Vermithor following shortly after. The two caught up with the fleet that had just begun to sail.</p><p>Levana ordered for Vermithor to fly a bit lower so she could converse with the fleet captain who gave her a wave as the dragon flew alongside the ship.</p><p>"Where to, Princess Levana?" The captain asked as Levana looked toward the East, her heart aching slightly at the distant sight of the mountains of Dragonstone. She shook her head as she stroked Vermithor's neck before looking at the captain.</p><p>"To King's Landing."</p>

<p>It was the dawn of a new day when the maesters presented an urgent matter to Princess Rhaenyra. The Targaryen wondered what matter would be so important as to require her attention at that time of day but once she was handed the letter from the raven, she understood.</p><p>Rhaenrya expected a raven from Driftmark as she requested for her daughter to be escorted to Dragonstone at the earliest possible time. She was hoping that the letter would inform her of Princess Levana's arrival in the hours to come.</p><p>With a deep breath, Rhaenyra unraveled the letter and read its contents only to be taken aback at the revelation from Princess Rhaenys.</p><p>Her daughter will not be joining her in Dragonstone. Instead, Levana had made the decision to travel to King's Landing.</p><p>Rhaenyra was distraught. She quickly summoned her Lord Husband, Prince Daemon who came knocking at her chambers soon after.</p><p>
<em>Princess Levana has decided by her own accord to travel to King's Landing to be with her Grandsire and betrothed. I will be escorting her and Vermithor at dawn.</em>
</p><p>Daemon chuckled in amusement as he handed the letter back to his wife, "well, she's better off there."</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at him in disbelief, "Levana is my daughter and her place is here in Dragonstone."</p><p>The male raised a brow, "and yet you made the decision to leave her in High Tide so she could be a reprieve to Ser Laenor's death."</p><p>"I did that for Levana, she at least deserved to be around Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys after Laenor's death."</p><p>"You still abandoned her."</p><p>The princess looked at Daemon in disbelief, "I will fly to King's Landing and retrieve her."</p><p>The Rogue Prince shook his head, "let Levana go."</p><p>"She's my daughter!"</p><p>"And she's made her own choices," Daemon interjected, "young as she is she already made this decision for herself and it's one that you should also respect."</p><p>Rhaenyra sighed, "no one is going to help her there, Daemon."</p><p>"She has my brother," Daemon reasoned, "I doubt Viserys is going to allow anything to happen to his favorite grandchild."</p><p>"You cannot remove my worry," Rhaenyra began, "Levana is my daughter too and the regret I feel is deep for leaving her in Driftmark when Laenor died."</p><p>"I left her when she needed me the most, Daemon."</p><p>Daemon raised a brow, "then you'll be there when she needs you again, on her wedding day."</p><p>"Daemon, that's years from now," Rhaenyra reminded, "I do not intend to be apart from my daughter for that long."</p><p>"Do you believe that she'll want to be around you after you abandoned her?" Daemon asked, "Levana might not take this as lightly as you think."</p><p>Rhaenyra took a deep breath before looking at the letter again and holding it close to her heart. She looked toward the window of her room and watched the rising sun. Levana would be nearing King's Landing by now and while a part of her did find it hard to be apart from her daughter - maybe Daemon was right.</p><p>Maybe Levana didn't need her as much as she thought.</p><p>Still, she was the child's mother and she just couldn't leave her daughter alone. The decision itself to be with the King and Aemond was something that utterly shocked Rhaenyra. It made her remember the conversation she had with Queen Alicent the day that she proposed marriage between their children.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Rhaenyra and Laenor were asked to assemble at the King's chambers by the request of the Queen. Both of them had no clue as to why they had been summoned and it was unlikely that they were getting an apology from Queen Alicent about the incident that happened the night prior.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Your Graces," Rhaenyra greeted as she and her husband entered her father's chambers. Queen Alicent sat down beside the King who had just finished drinking his </em>
<b>
<em>medicine.</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<em>"Daughter," King Viserys spoke first, "I do apologize for the incident that occurred last night," he sighed, "I have yet to extend my apologies to Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys but it is to you that I should apologize first."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rhaenyra shook her head, "please, my King, the matter is over with."</em>
</p><p>
<em>King Viserys smiled weakly at his daughter before looking over to his Queen who cleared her throat.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I've been unkind to you, Princess Rhaenyra," Queen Alicent stated, "there is indeed a rift within our family and one that will continue to get large if not addressed."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Laenor looked at Rhaenyra with furrowed brows before holding her hand, "what are you proposing, Your Grace?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Queen smiled slightly before taking a deep breath, "just before you left King's Landing, you proposed to marry Jacaerys to my Helaena."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Are you proposing marriage between them now?" Rhaenyra almost chuckled, letting go of Laenor's hand, "Helaena is set to marry Aegon, is she not?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>King Viserys nodded, "they will be wed to keep our blood pure."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Then what are you insinuating?" Rhaeynra asked as Queen Alicent stood up from her seat and walked closer to Rhaenyra..</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I would like to propose a match myself," Queen Alicent began, "between Princess Levana and Aemond."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Laenor's eyes shot wide, "my daughter and Aemond?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Velaryon was prepared to present the Queen with a couple of choice words when Rhaenyra placed a hand on his shoulder. For a while, the princess was silent and dared not to talk.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Rhaenyra?" Laenor asked, "you aren't considering this, are you?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>The female hushed him as the male rolled his eyes in disbelief, "Aemond called our sons, bastards."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I don't see why that has anything to do with Levana," Queen Alicent responded.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Levana is their older sister," Laenor responded, "and will all do respect, Queen Alicent, your son disrespected my children."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Ser Laenor, stop."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Rhaenyra."</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Princess looked at the Queen and smiled slightly, "my daughter is next in line to the throne after me."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"I acknowledge that," Queen Alicent stated.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"If Levana is to be Queen then Aemond will be her King Consort," Rhaenyra stated as the King and Queen nodded.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Aemond will be ready for that," King Viserys interjected. There was a visible look of distaste on the Queen's face but she shrugged it off.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Laenor shook his head, "with all do res--"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"We accept your offer," Rhaenyra stated, "I do believe that Levana and Aemond are a good match."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Rhaenyra," Laenor grabbed her arm, "don't do this."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Levana will be marrying her closest friend," Rhaenyra said, "and Aemond will be with his closest friend."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Queen Alicent and the King nodded as Rhaenyra nodded, "it will be set then."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Once the discussion was over, Rhaenyra and Laenor found themselves back in their quarters. The male was leaned against the door as Rhaenyra sat on the couch. The Velaryon male couldn't believe what had just transpired.</em>
</p><p>
<em>While he had nothing against Aemond, it was the very thought of marrying his daughter to their side of his family that filled his mouth with distaste.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"What were you thinking?" Laenor asked, "our daughter and Aemond?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"This could work in our favor in the future, Laenor," Rhaenyra stated, "Levana is going to be the answer to our problems with the Greens."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"The Iron Throne will not cost me my daughter!"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Our daughter will sit on that throne after I do," Rhaenyra said sternly, "Levana will strengthen her claim to the throne and by extension, mine."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"She's only nine, Rhaenyra," Laenor defended, "even we weren't bethroned this young."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Levana will have time," Rhaenyra promised, "and </em>
<b>
<em>I'll </em>
</b>
<em>be there to prepare her."</em>
</p><p>
<em>Laenor knelt beside the couch where his wife was seated and held her hand, "who will protect her, Rhaenyra?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Laenor," Rhaenyra sighed, "if a war for the throne does come, she will be better off in King's Landing," she stated.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"They won't touch her there," The princess added, "she will be better protected and I wouldn't have to see her die by their hands."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"And you would let her die by yours?" Laenor asked, "if she sides with the Greens by marriage, she will be your enemy."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Laenor," Rhaenyra hissed, "our daughter's life is my first priority and I will not see it end because of a war."</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"Laenor will curse me in the seven hells for this," Rhaenyra muttered under her breath as Daemon chuckled, wrapping an arm around his wife's figure.</p><p>"Levana will be fine," Daemon assured, "at the very least, she will be looked after in King's Landing and she will be spoiled there."</p><p>Princess Rhaenyra raised a brow, "will she not be protected here with <em>us</em>?"</p><p>Daemon smirked, "I already have my daughters to worry about."</p><p>"What did you say?" Rhaenyra asked in disbelief, "she is no different from my other children, Daemon."</p><p>"She is by paternity," Daemon responded, "by default, Levana has been treated better than her younger brothers for the majority of her life."</p><p>"Are you blaming that on my daughter?"</p><p>"All that I'm saying, Rhaenyra," Daemon sighed, "is that Levana will manage in King's Landing without us."</p><p>Rhaenyra was in disbelief.</p><p>"Tell me," Daemon said, "do you love her as much as you love your other children?"</p><p>The princess glared, "I love Levana with my whole heart."</p><p>"But she isn't <em>like </em>your other children."</p><p>Rhaenyra paused for a while, "I never should've allowed you to convince me to leave her."</p><p>Daemon chuckled, "Rhaenyra, you wanted to leave her there as a contingency and I just supported your decision."</p><p>"You suggested for her to be used as an assurance for my claim and you were the one who wanted to use her in the event that the greens would try to usurp me."</p><p>Daemon shrugged, "well, if you cared so much for your daughter then why did you agree with me?"</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at him in disbelief before dismissing the conversation, opting to find solace in Levana's former quarters. Part of her wanted to be mad at Daemon because of his accusation but there was a part of her that also believed that he might be right.</p><p>Levana wasn't like any of her other children.</p><p>
<b>She was different.</b>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana let out a thrilled shout as the Dragonpit came to view. While Vermithor was not a resident of the pits, that was the only place that he was allowed to land so as to not cause <em>any damage </em>to King's Landing and the Red Keep. Meleys, on the other hand, was comparatively small enough to fit in the pits unlike Vermithor whose size won't allow him to fit inside.</p><p>Levana ordered her dragon to make his landing and soon enough, she was faced by the keepers of the Dragonpit.</p><p><em>"Please be careful with Vermithor," </em>Levana smiled as the keepers bowed their heads. The princess hopped off her dragon shortly and gave his neck a couple of strokes before ordering for him to find his place just near the pits.</p><p>Rhaenys and Meleys would land shortly after, the Red Queen proceeding to the Dragonpit as the two princesses made their way to the entourage waiting for them.</p><p>"Princess Rhaenys, Princess Levana," Ser Westerling greeted as Levana bowed her head slightly in acknowledgement, "the King and the Queen are expecting you for luncheon," the Knight stated as Rhaenys gave the knight a greeting before boarding the carriage. Levana thought for a while before looking up Ser Westerling, "can I ride on horseback?" She asked as the knight chuckled.</p><p>"We shall get you your own horse, Your Grace," Ser Westerling promised as Levana nodded and boarded the carriage. Soon enough, they were on their way to the Red Keep.</p><p>"Levana, keep your handmaidens close to you at all times," Rhaenys reminded, "they have known you since you were small and they will be your closest allies."</p><p>"Especially Galatea," Rhaenys stated, "if I am to trust any of your handmaidens with your life, it is her."</p><p>Levana nodded at the reminder as she looked at her grandmother, "I will miss you and Grandsire," she admitted, "but I think that this is where I belong."</p><p>Rhaenys smiled and nodded, "I have no doubt that your Grandsire, the King, would be elated to have you with him."</p><p>"Do you think the King will allow me to go riding on my own?" Levana asked only to be met by a chuckle of amusement from her grandmother, "I doubt you will be able to do anything alone under his watchful eye."</p><p>There was a moment of silence between them as Levana began to scratch at her arm through the fabric of her riding gear. Rhaenys sighed and took the princess' hand in hers.</p><p>"Just please promise me one thing, Levana," Rhaenys began, "at the first sign of trouble, you will send a raven to Driftmark and I will fetch you on dragonback."</p><p>Levana nodded, "I promise, grandmother."</p><p>"Seek help from your Grandsire as well," Rhaenys added, "he will make sure that you are safe and well-taken care of while you are in the Red Keep."</p><p>Levana gave her grandmother another nod before leaning her head against her arm, "Grandmother?"</p><p>Rhaenys smiled, "yes, little one?"</p><p>"Am I a bad child?" Levana asked, "have I done something to my family?"</p><p>Rhaenys shook her head, "no," she teared up slightly, "you are the kindest heart that I have known and you make us immensely proud, Levana."</p><p>"Then why was I abandoned?"</p><p>"Your mother might have abandoned you but I will not," Rhaenys promised, "I will be here for you and I will protect you."</p><p>Levana embraced her grandmother tightly. Rhaenys could hear the small sobs from her granddaughter but she chose to comfort her silently, stroking her hair and rubbing her back.</p><p>In the back of her mind, she was angry at Princess Rhaenyra for many things but the most that she hated her for was <em>abandoning </em>her own daughter when she needed her the most. Rhaenys would have to stay vigilant to protect Levana at all costs.</p><p>There isn't anything that Rhaenys wouldn't do for her granddaughter — her only memory of her son, Laenor.</p>

<p>Readjusting to life in the Red Keep wasn't difficult but it wasn't easy either.</p><p>While Levana had the company of her handmaidens and Galatea to help make the transition easier, it was the company of Aemond and Helaena who made things more bearable.</p><p>In the few months that she's been there, she's heard whispers about herself and her mother but she learned to ignore them. As with Princess Rhaenys and Galatea's advice, she must learn how to choose her battles as she doesn't have viable defenses - except for the King - in the Red Keep.</p><p>Queen Alicent also unexpectedly warmed up to her in the few months that she stayed in the Red Keep. Although, Galatea suspects that the Queen is only being kind to her out of pity and to get in the King's good graces.</p><p>Levana was, after all, the favorite - whether the King admitted to it or not, it was obvious by the way that he treated her.</p><p>"Princess," Septa Titania called as Levana turned to her with a small frown, "we must continue with your studies."</p><p>"But I want to ride my dragon," Levana reasoned, "it's been weeks since I last saw Vermithor."</p><p>Septa Titania sighed, "Princess Levana, it is by order of the Queen to give you your lessons today," she stated, "the dragon can wait."</p><p>"No, it cannot," Levana responded, "why is Aemond free to fly Vhagar any time that he likes and I have to be stuck in this library?"</p><p>"Princess," Septa Titania sighed, "you are a woman and your place will be beside your husband when he is King."</p><p>"What did you say?" Levana asked in disbelief.</p><p>"You are a woman and the Dragonpit is no place for a princess," Septa Titania stated as Levana shook her head.</p><p>"Do not let my grandfather hear you say that," Levana stated, "I may be a woman but I am born from the blood of Old Valyria and I am a dragonrider."</p><p>"But you are still a woman, princess," Septa Titania pointed out as the doors of the library opened to reveal Ser Westerling with a stern expression on his face. Levana smiled, she knew that her sworn protector was someone that she would rely on.</p><p>"Septa Titania," Ser Westerling spoke before looking at the princess and giving her a small smile.</p><p>"The princess is to be escorted to the Dragonpit by order of the King," The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard stated as Levana excitedly hopped off her seat and ran towards the male.</p><p>"Go on ahead," Ser Westerling stated, "your betrothed is waiting for you in the carriage."</p><p>With a wide smile, Levana ran off in the direction of the stables, leaving Ser Westerling with the Septa who was muttering to herself while she collected the books that the Princess was studying.</p><p>"Best not to let the King hear you lecture his granddaughter about being a woman," Ser Westerling advised, "it is the King's wish that Princess Levana be extended the same freedom as Prince Aemond."</p><p>Septa Titania looked down and bowed her head in acknowledgment before scurrying to return the books. Ser Westerling, on the other hand, proceeded to the stables where the carriage was waiting for his arrival.</p><p>"You walk slowly, Ser Westerling!" Levana giggled from the door of the carriage as the knight bowed his head before proceeding to mount his horse.</p><p>"I apologize, My Princess," Ser Westerling smiled, "there was a matter that needed to be settled before we headed to the Dragonpit."</p><p>Levana smiled before closing the door to the carriage and sitting across from Aemond.</p><p>Aemond's eye seemed to be healing well from the <em>incident</em>. Levana apologized to him numerous times in her brothers' stead when she reunited with her betrothed but the latter would always shrug it off.</p><p>It wasn't her apology to say was what Aemond always told her.</p><p>Levana looked at Aemond as he fiddled with the straps of his eyepatch. Carefully, the princess stood up to help the prince with his dilemma but the latter was quick to move away from her.</p><p>"I can manage," Aemond stated as he fixed his straps, "you don't have to help me all the time."</p><p>"But I want to," Levana reasoned, "we're supposed to be helping each other."</p><p>"Not until we're married," Aemond responded, "I'm not a clumsy kid anymore, Levana."</p><p>Levana chuckled, "I never said you were."</p><p>Aemond paused for a bit, "still, I don't need your help all the time and I'm supposed to be the one helping you."</p><p>Levana stuck her tongue out at him, "we're supposed to be helping each other," she repeated before taking her seat across from the prince.</p><p>"Do you have news of your mother?" Aemond asked as Levana pursed her lips and shook her head.</p><p>"I've sent many ravens but all of them are unanswered."</p><p>The prince could feel the sudden change in Levana's mood which prompted him to move to the seat beside her. The princess smiled at the gesture and gave him a small nod of thanks.</p><p>"Vermithor must miss you," Aemond began, "I try my best to approach him but it seems that he only wants to see you."</p><p>Levana chuckled, "well, he is <b>my </b>dragon, after all."</p><p>Aemond smiled, he liked seeing her happy.</p><p>"Mother said that she was going to take over some of your lessons," The prince stated as Levana nodded, "she volunteered and I wanted to take the opportunity to learn from the queen."</p><p>Aemond puffed his cheeks.</p><p>"Maybe you should attend my lessons as well, Aemond," Levana offered, "when I am Queen then you'll be my King! We'll have similar duties and we can learn how to best help each other."</p><p>"Do you really believe that you'll become Queen?"</p><p>Levana smiled at him plainly, "I don't want to be a Queen but it's my birthright and it's something that I must do."</p><p>"If you had a choice to escape from it, would you?"</p><p>Aemond's question made Levana's eyes widen. She honestly hasn't thought of that yet and it wasn't something that she was prepared to answer.</p><p>"It's our duty, Aemond," Levana stated, "this is something that we must do for our families."</p><p>"We have a few years to decide," Aemond stated, "but if I am to be king, you are the only one that I want to be my queen."</p><p>The princess smiled and pinched his cheek, "I'm glad that you find me bearable."</p><p>"I enjoy your company," Aemond smiled, "because you also don't mind mine."</p><p>Levana smiled at him, "I would rather your company than that of others," she said, "thank you."</p><p>Aemond nodded as the carriage went to a halt. The princess excitedly opened the carriage doors and hurried out to meet her dragon who was already waiting for her.</p><p>The prince followed after her, watching Levana as she reunited with Vermithor. Ser Westerling approached him and placed a hand on his shoulder, "I hope you do not tire of Princess Levana's company, my prince."</p><p>Aemond shook his head, "it's hard to grow tired of her company when she's surprising."</p><p>Ser Westerling chuckled, "off you go then, my Prince," he gestured for Aemond to join Levana who was already mounted on her dragon, teasing the prince for being so slow.</p><p>The two never cease to entertain him.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"What are we going to tell Levana?" Queen Alicent asked as she looked at the letter in her hands and then at her husband who let out a weak sigh.</p><p>"This was expected," King Viserys stated, "we should've known from the beginning."</p><p>"How long has this been going on?" The Queen skimmed through the letter again, "don't tell me that the reason why she abandoned her own daughter was because of this."</p><p>"My dear wife," King Viserys turned to her, "let's not jump to conclusions."</p><p>Queen Alicent grunted, "what other explanation is there?"</p><p>"Alicent."</p><p>"Levana was abandoned in High Tide and her mother was in Dragonstone with Daemon," Alicent pointed out, "<em>our </em>granddaughter was left to fend for herself upon the death of her father while Rhaenyra married Daemon."</p><p>King Viserys sighed, "I also feel pity for Levana but I do not want to crucify Rhaenyra because of this assumption."</p><p>"My King," Alicent began, "this is an injustice towards Levana."</p><p>The king knew that his wife was trying to use his love for Levana against Rhaenyra. But he would have to remain objective - he didn't know the whole story either but he agreed that there was, indeed, injustice towards his granddaughter.</p><p>"What would you have me do?" King Viserys asked, "We do not have the truth of it, Alicent."</p><p>"Bring Rhaenyra here to answer for what she's done," Queen Alicent suggested, "Daemon must not be present as he will manipulate the situation for sure."</p><p>"He is her husband" King Viserys interjected as the Queen looked at him plainly.</p><p>"And Levana is her trueborn daughter," the Queen stated firmly, "the only daughter of Driftmark that she has."</p><p>"Alicent."</p><p>"Mind you, My King," Queen Alicent began, "Rhaenyra has never officially named an heir to succeed her should she ascend the throne."</p><p>"What are you implying?" The King asked.</p><p>"Rhaenyra might not name Levana as her heir," The Queen said, "Levana is the rightful heir as the first and trueborn."</p><p>King Viserys let out a groan before summoning the Maester who promptly entered the room.</p><p>"Send a raven to Dragonstone," King Viserys began, "I request the presence of Princess Rhaenyra and her alone."</p><p>The Maester nodded before bowing his head and walking out of the room to send out the raven.</p><p>"You better know what you're doing, Alicent," The King looked up at his wife and sighed, "I do not wish to separate my daughter and granddaughter this way."</p><p>"But they've both made their choices, My King," Queen Alicent responded, "and Levana has been settling well with us."</p><p>"We will wait for Rhaenyra and put an end to this discussion."</p>

</p><p> </p><p>The days that followed after the invitation was sent to Dragonstone were filled with anxiousness. Queen Alicent had no choice but to tell Levana as she might wonder about the presence of Syrax in the Dragonpit</p><p>"Is my mother really coming?"</p><p>Queen Alicent nodded with a small smile as Levana was dressed by Galatea. The young princess' eyes brightened up as she clapped her hands in joy.</p><p>"Will she bring my brothers, Your Grace?" Levana asked but unfortunately, the queen shook her head.</p><p>"There is an important matter that your grandsire and I must discuss with your mother," Queen Alicent stated, "and for that, I ask you to stay away from the Great Hall."</p><p>"I would rather she be there."</p><p>Both females turned to the door to see King Viserys standing by it, "since the matter does concern her."</p><p>"Me, grandsire?"</p><p>Queen Alicent shook her head, "she doesn't need to be there to witness such a thing."</p><p>"She will be there by the request of the king," King Viserys smiled at his granddaughter before turning his back, "she and Rhaenyra need to discuss this as well."</p><p>With that, the king began to walk away from Levana's chambers just as the princess hopped off from the dressing stool that she stood on. The Queen looked at Levana with a warm smile and stroked her hair.</p><p>"Whatever comes out of today, young princess," Queen Alicent began, "your presence in the Red Keep has made it more lively and Aemond isn't the only one who thinks so."</p><p>Levana smiled at the queen and wrapped her arms around the older female's waist, "thank you, Queen Alicent," she began, "for being kind to me and for being my mother."</p><p>Queen Alicent looked down at her before gesturing for Galatea to finish her preparations. The queen left the room shortly after, leaving the princess and her handmaiden to their own devices as Levana took a seat in front of her vanity.</p><p>"Princess," Galatea began, "if given the chance today, would you return to Dragonstone?"</p><p>Levana looked at her handmaiden through the mirror and thought for a while before shrugging slightly. Galatea braided the princess' hair into an intricate bun as the latter sat in silence, resigning to play with the hairbrush in her hands.</p><p>"Why do you think my mother left me in High Tide?"</p><p>"Princess, it's not my place."</p><p>"And yet you ask me if I would return to Dragonstone."</p><p>Galatea bowed her head in apology as she finished the princess' bun and placed a golden headband on her head. Levana tilted her head slightly at the sight of the headband and turned to her handmaiden, "this isn't mine."</p><p>Galatea smiled, "it's a gift from the Queen."</p><p>The princess nodded before standing up from her chair and walking out of her room with Galatea in tow. She was headed to the library when she was stopped by Ser Westerling.</p><p>"Princess Rhaenyra has arrived, Your Grace," he stated as Levana's eyes brightened up in excitement, she rushed past the knight to head to the stables when Ser Westerling managed to catch up with her and shook his head.</p><p>"King Viserys and Queen Alicent request that you only see Princess Rhaenyra at the Grand Hall," Ser Westerling stated, "my apologies, Princess Levana."</p><p>The princess' smile quickly turned into a frown when she gave the knight a nod and retreated to the library. She was disappointed that she couldn't even greet her mother but if it was what her grandparents thought best, she would have to respect it.</p><p>Levana found herself in the company of her books once more. She was allowed free time to read in the library without the Septa giving her lessons. This was her favorite time of the day - when she could just appreciate the silence that surrounded her.</p><p>"Eva?"</p><p>Levana looked up from her books to see Aemond. The princess waved at him and gestured for him to join her to which the prince gladly accepted.</p><p>"Aren't you supposed to see your mother today?" Aemond asked, taking a seat beside Levana as the princess positioned the book so that they could share it.</p><p>"I was told to wait here until someone came for me," Levana sighed, "I wanted to greet her when she arrived but Ser Westerling told me that I must wait until I am summoned."</p><p>The prince shrugged as he looked down at what the princess was reading and sighed, "this again, Eva?"</p><p>Levana giggled, not because of the prince's comment but because of the nickname that he had decided to give her because he wanted to give her one that was different from what her brothers' called her.</p><p>"It's my favorite book, Aemond."</p><p>"Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen, as always," Aemond looked at the book again and read through some of the text. There was silence between the two as they read the book until Aemond decided to break it with a question.</p><p>
<em>"Will you return to Dragonstone?"</em>
</p><p>Levana turned to him and thought for a while. In all honesty, she didn't know how to respond because she also didn't know what to say. She's been away from her family for months and while she did want to go back, she feared that she might've become distant from them.</p><p>She wouldn't know how to adjust to life with them again.</p><p><em>"We'll cross that bridge when we get there," </em>Levana smiled, <em>"don't worry, if I do return to Dragonstone, I will write to you."</em></p><p>Aemond frowned, <em>"it will be lonely again once you leave."</em></p><p><em>"Aemond,"</em> Levana chuckled, <em>"don't think that I'm going to leave yet, I haven't spoken to my mother yet."</em></p><p>Just as Aemond was to respond, the doors opened to reveal Queen Alicent with Ser Cole in tow.</p><p>"Levana," The Queen called as the two children stood up from the table, "it's time."</p><p>Levana nodded and bid her farewell to Aemond before walking toward the queen.</p><p>"Can I come?" Aemond asked as Queen Alicent shook her head, "this is a matter for Levana and her alone to witness."</p><p>With that, the Queen left the library with Ser Cole and Levana in tow. Aemond, on the other hand, decided that he would still try and sneak into the Grand Hall.</p><p>Aemond didn't want to see Levana leave but he didn't want her to have to go through this alone either.</p>

<p>Levana was told to wait to be presented in the Grand Hall where her grandparents and mother were already waiting inside. Her heart thumped against her chest which prompted her to scratch her forearm. The nervousness in her heart was starting to get to her when she felt a hand on her shoulder. </p><p>“It’s time, princess,” Ser Westerling stated as Levana gave him a nod. She took a deep breath as the large doors of the Grand Hall began to open. </p><p>“Princess Levana of Houses Targaryen and Velaryon, the second in line to inherit the Iron Throne.” </p><p>With her introduction, Levana began to walk towards the empty hall. Those in attendance were the King and Queen, her mother and siblings, and of course, the Hand.</p><p>“Ana!”</p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys made a beeline for their sister who welcomed them with open arms. The two boys embraced her tightly as the younger of the three began to cry, “we missed you so much,” Lucerys sobbed into his sister’s arms. </p><p>“Boys,” Rhaenyra called as the two turned to their mother, “let your sister proceed to the throne first.” </p><p>Levana shook her head, “this is quite alright, mother.” </p><p>“Princess Levana, to your Grandsire’s side, please,” Queen Alicent requested as the young princess shrugged before kissing the heads of her brothers and proceeding in front of the throne. </p><p>“My king,” Levana bowed as she proceeded to his side. </p><p>“We appreciate your presence, Princess Rhaenyra though I do remember requesting that you come alone,” Queen Alicent looked towards the young boys beside the older princess who smiled slightly. </p><p>“They wanted to see their older sister,” Rhaenyra stated, “and I was not about to deprive them of such." </p><p>"You had hoped to use them to sway Levana to return to Dragonstone," Queen Alicent accused, "didn't you?" </p><p>"Alicent," King Viserys stated, "I would rather that we let Princess Rhaenyra explain what happened at the death of Ser Laenor." </p><p>Princess Levana could feel the tension in the room grow denser as those in attendance refused to speak. Levana would turn her attention to her mother and then to the Queen then back to her mother, waiting for someone to speak. </p><p>Her nervousness got the best of her and she started to scratch at her arm again. Queen Alicent took notice of this but as she was about to approach Levana, Rhaenyra cleared her throat. </p><p>"It was unfortunate, what happened to my husband and to Levana's father," Rhaenyra began, "the decision to leave Levana was a decision that I did not consider properly and I apologize for this, my sweet one.” </p><p>“You admit to abandoning Levana on purpose?” Queen Alicent asked as Princess Rhaenyra shook her head, “I did it because I would be leaving her with Laenor.” </p><p>“Do you admit to knowing something about Ser Laenor’s death?” Queen Alicent raised a brow as the princess turned to the king who groaned a response. </p><p>“You abandoned my granddaughter in Driftmark to be with her father whilst you marry Daemon in Dragonstone?” King Viserys almost raised his voice, “do you understand how this could affect my grandchildren, Rhaenyra?” </p><p>Rhaenyra was silent for a while before she turned to Levana, “come home to me, my dear child.” </p><p>Levana turned to her mother and then to the king, “that’s it?” </p><p>“What do you mean?” Rhaenyra asked, “I am here to fetch you, Levana.” </p><p>“I was left here for months, mother,” Levana reasoned, “if you truly wanted me back then you would have fetched me the day that I decided to go to King’s Landing.” </p><p>Rhaenyra was caught off guard, “what have they done to you?” </p><p>Levana couldn’t believe what her mother just said, “in the months that you did not return my letters, Queen Alicent raised me as her own and my Grandsire took care of me.” </p><p>“What letters?” Rhaenyra asked, “I received no letters, Levana.” </p><p>Levana’s eyes widened, “I must have sent you a hundred ravens, mother,” she stated, “and I never received anything back from you.” </p><p>“I did not receive letters, Levana,” Rhaenyra placed a hand to her chest, “I swear it.” </p><p>The hall was once again filled with silence. </p><p>“It must be Daemon,” Queen Alicent accused, “you might want to consider asking your new husband about what happened to the letters from Levana.” </p><p>“Darling,” Rhaenyra looked towards Levana, “I’m sorry, I really am.” </p><p>Levana was quiet for a while. </p><p>“Then why did it take you so long to take me back?” </p><p>Rhaenyra was at a loss for words.</p><p>“I waited for you, mother,” Levana began to tear up, “but you never came.” </p><p>Perhaps it was because Levana was too young to know anger or resentment but instead, she only knew sadness and hurt.</p><p>“I felt like I lost both my parents the night that father died, mother,” Levana choked on a sob, even when I was in Driftmark, you didn’t come and get me.” </p><p>“I asked for you to be sent to Drago--” </p><p>“You could’ve come personally, mother!” Levana raised her voice. At the realization, she covered her mouth and looked at the adults in the room who were visibly shocked. The younger princess then looked at her younger brothers and bowed her head.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” </p><p>King Viserys looked up at Levana and shook his head, “there is nothing to apologize for,” he stated as he turned to his daughter. </p><p>“What say you about this, Rhaenyra?” King Visersys asked in a disappointed tone, “would you like a moment alone with your daughter after hearing what she feels about your abandonment?” </p><p>“I…” Rhaenyra looked at Levana who was wiping her tears, “I would like to speak to my daughter alone.” </p><p>“Levana, would you like to speak to your mother?” </p><p>Levana was silent for a while before nodding slowly.</p><p>“Very well,” King Viserys sighed, “your sons will have to wait in the library while you and Levana discuss in her chambers.” </p><p>“I’ll take Levana to her chambers,” Queen Alicent stated as King Viserys nodded, “boys, Ser Westerling will take you to the library.” </p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys nodded as Levana stepped down from the throne. The boys hurried to their sister and embraced her tightly; Lucerys was still crying as Levana stroked his head. </p><p>“All will be well, Luke, Jace,” Levana whispered as she embraced them as well. </p><p>“Please come home with us, Ana,” Jacaerys sobbed as the princess sighed, “please,” he repeated. </p><p>“Jace, Luke,” Levana began, “I’ll talk to the both of you after I speak with mother, yes?” </p><p>The two boys nodded and reluctantly separated from their sister who walked alongside Queen Alicent while the boys were escorted to the library - leaving Rhaenyra alone with her father. </p><p>“I want the truth of it, Rhaenyra.” </p><p>“Father?” </p><p>“Why did you leave my granddaughter to fend for herself in Driftmark while you married Daemon?” King Viserys questioned, “and why did you have to arrange an escort for her instead of coming for her yourself?” </p><p>Rhaenyra was silent for a while before she sighed. </p><p>“I had hoped that Levana would be able to stay with Laenor,” Rhaenyra stated, “I didn’t want to separate the two of them.” </p><p>“So you figured that you would take Ser Laenor’s sons and take them with you but not your firstborn daughter?” </p><p>“She would be better left in Driftmark,” Rhaenyra reasoned, “I did not want to involve her in what I’ve done.” </p><p>
<b>“That is still not a reason for you to abandon your daughter!” </b>
</p><p>King Viserys clutched at his chest, breathing heavily as Rhaenyra ran up to him; holding him. </p><p>“Father, I’ll call for a maester.” </p><p>The king held Rhaenyra’s hand tightly, “I’ve forgiven you in the past for what you have done but I will not forgive or defend you for abandoning your daughter, Rhaenyra.” </p><p>The princess was silent as the maesters rushed into the Grand Hall. </p><p>Rhaenyra helped her father stand up as the maesters went to assist them. </p><p>“You will not take Levana from King’s Landing,” King Viserys said, <b>“that is an order from the king.”</b> </p>

<p>Levana sat in her chambers, waiting for her mother to come when Aemond burst through the door. The princess looked at the young boy with an amused expression as he marched towards her.</p><p>"Don't leave, Eva."</p><p>"Aemond, I'm not going anywhere," Levana stated, "you're not supposed to be in here."</p><p>"I know," Aemond responded, "I just don't want to see you leave."</p><p>"You need not worry because the king has barred Levana from leaving King's Landing."</p><p>The two children turned towards the door where Rhaenyra stood, her hands folded across her chest.</p><p>"Prince Aemond," Rhaenyra chuckled, "why is it that I always seem to catch you in my daughter's chambers?"</p><p>Aemond looked at Levana for a short while before giving her a nod and walking out of the room. Rhaenyra watched as the prince left before closing the door behind her and facing her daughter with a sad smile.</p><p>"Did Grandsire really forbid me from leaving?" Levana asked as her mother nodded.</p><p>"Maybe it is for the best," Rhaenyra said as she sat beside her daughter. Levana moved closer to her mother and leaned her head on her shoulder.</p><p>"You must hate me."</p><p>"I think that is too much of a strong emotion for me to feel, mother," Levana responded. She was young and hate was an emotion that she was yet to fully understand. Levana might have a hint of what it felt like but she felt like it wasn't enough.</p><p>"Why did it take you long to retrieve me, mother?" Levana asked, "do you not want me anymore?"</p><p>The question made Rhaenyra tear up as she wrapped an arm around her, pulling her closer.</p><p>"It took me long because I had to make sure that we were settled before I could ask Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys to escort you to Dragonstone."</p><p>"I waited, mother," Levana began to cry, "I felt so alone."</p><p>Rhaenyra's heart broke as her daughter sobbed in her arms. She stroked her daughter's hair, holding one hand in hers. She noticed the ring that Levana wore and lifted her hand.</p><p>"Did your father give this to you?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana looked at the ring and nodded.</p><p>"He gave it to me the night that he died," Levana explained, "he said that it was very important to him."</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled, "this ring once belonged to Ser Joffrey Lonmouth," she explained as she observed her daughter, "he was a very important person to your father."</p><p>Levana marveled at the ring. She didn't know the reason why the ring was important to her father but at the very least, she now knew what it meant.</p><p>"If I am barred from leaving King's Landing," Levana began, "will you at least visit me with Jace, Luke, and Joff?"</p><p>Rhaenyra nodded, "we will try to visit often."</p><p>"I don't want my brothers to be distant from me," Levana sighed, "I want to be there for them too."</p><p>The older princess wrapped her daughter in a tight embrace and kissed the top of her head, "do not be distant from me either, my love."</p><p>Levana nodded, "yes mother."</p><p>"We will come for your Name Day," Rhaenyra smiled,<b> "it will be a celebration to remember."</b></p><p>Levana smiled at her mother and nodded again, she fiddled with her fingers as the silence enveloped the both of them before the older princess asked, "have they been hospitable to you here?"</p><p>"Yes, they have!" Levana said excitedly, "the Septa provides me with lessons, I get to spend time in the library, and the Queen also spends time teaching me!"</p><p>"The Queen?" Rhaenyra raised a brow, "she spends time with you?"</p><p>"Yes mother," Levana responded, "she also reads to me and Helaena sometimes but not always because she often says that she has to deal with Aegon."</p><p>The part about Aegon did not surprise Rhaenyra as she knew her younger half-brother to be somewhat of a troublemaker but the fact that the Queen was spending time with her daughter made her wonder if there was an ulterior motive behind it.</p><p>"What else does Queen Alicent teach you, Levana?"</p><p>Levana shrugged, "sometimes it's history, sometimes religion, but sometimes she just reads to me."</p><p>"She doesn't mention me or anyone else from the family?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana shook her head.</p><p>"The Queen often tells me stories about the King and Aegon when he was growing up but never you or anyone else, mother."</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled slightly. At the very least, she knew that Alicent wasn't manipulating her own child against her.</p><p>"Mother," Levana hopped off the bed, "would you like to go around the castle with me?"</p><p>Rhaenyra nodded before standing up, "show me the places where you often spend your time in."</p><p>Levana excitedly nodded before taking her mother's hand in hers and marching out of her room. While there were things that boggled Rhaenyra's mind, she would have to wait until she got back to Dragonstone to address some of the more compelling ones.</p><p>For now, she would spend time with her daughter whom she hasn't seen in months.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Saying farewell to Levana was, in truth, the hardest thing for Rhaenyra. She didn't have to do it the first time much to Daemon's insistence because the latter knew that it would be hard for both the princess'.</p><p>But now, Rhaenyra knew the pain of it. The crying of her sons also did not help when they boarded the boat to Dragonstone and Levana stood alongside Ser Westerling by the docks. Her daughter was barred from returning to Dragonstone and as Rhaenyra put it, it would probably be for the best.</p><p>She knew that Daemon was not particularly fond of her daughter and she was yet to find out why.</p><p>Upon arriving in Dragonstone, Rhaenyra summoned Daemon to the library - she had many questions and she wanted answers to all of them.</p><p>"Rhaenyra," Daemon called as he entered the library, "you're back."</p><p>"Where are Levana's letters?" Rhaenyra asked outright, "have you been hiding my daughter's letters from me?"</p><p>Daemon smirked, "I told you that the sooner you remove the bond with Levana, the easier it would be for you."</p><p>"She's my daughter, Daemon!" Rhaenyra raised her voice, "she came from me and she is my heir."</p><p>"Your daughter to a man that you never loved."</p><p>"I loved Laenor," Rhaenyra interjected, "it was not the love that I might've had for you but I loved him and I love Levana."</p><p>"It's only a matter of time before the Greens manipulate her, Rhaenyra."</p><p>"She's not even ten!"</p><p>"She's easier to manipulate at this age!"</p><p>"You did this on purpose, didn't you?" Rhaenyra asked, "you wanted to separate Levana from me so you would have easier access to the throne."</p><p>Daemon chuckled, "you haven't even named an heir, Rhaenyra."</p><p>"I thought it was obvious who was going to be my heir," Rhaenyra responded, "Levana is my firstborn and my rightful heir."</p><p>"Of course," Daemon laughed, "extend to her the same courtesy that your father did to you."</p><p>"I will not have my children fighting over the throne, Daemon."</p><p>"Who says there would be a fight?" Daemon asked, "declare Jacaerys as your heir and Levana can inherit Driftmark."</p><p>"Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys would never agree because they know that Levana is my heir."</p><p>The prince raised a brow, "that's it?"</p><p>"What do you mean, that's it?"</p><p>"The Targaryen bloodline ends with your Velaryon daughter?"</p><p>"Levana is marrying into House Targaryen," Rhaenyra stated, "the children that she is to have with Aemond will inherit the Targaryen name."</p><p>Daemon could only watch his wife in amusement.</p><p>"You think that Aemond is going to act upon a childhood betrothal when he comes of age?" Daemon asked.</p><p>"I know enough that boys will turn into men and when they do, their desires change."</p><p>Rhaenyra glared at her husband before walking past him, "give me my daughter's letters," she hissed before leaving the library.</p><p>Daemon watched as Rhaenyra's figure disappeared into the halls before looking at the fire and chuckling to himself.</p><p>"Unless you can revive paper from flames," Daemon smiled, "there's no way you're getting those letters."</p>

<p>Time was, in many ways, an enemy to most. However, to Princess Levana, it was everything but that.</p><p>The princess stood on her dressing stool as Galatea and the other handmaidens fussed over the dresses that she would have to choose from for her Name Day. On her right, the Queen sat with her hands folded on her lap, observing the princess as she chose her dresses.</p><p>King Visersys was adamant that Princess Levana be given a <em>grand </em>celebration. Invitations were sent a month in advance so all those invited would be able to prepare for it adequately.</p><p>The celebration happened in a span of seven days. There was a hunt that spanned the first four days, a tourney on the fifth day, a small festival on the sixth day, and on the final day, there would be a grand feast.</p><p>This was the night of the feast that would then lead to the gazing of the Harvest Moon - it had been a family tradition to gather at the Godswood to gaze at the moon as it was at its highest during the night of Levana's Name Day.</p><p>For her tenth Name Day, the king wanted everyone to be able to gaze at the beauty of the moon - just as they were to gaze upon the beauty of his granddaughter.</p><p>"Levana, my child, this is the seventh dress," Queen Alicent stated as Levana puffed her cheeks before looking at all the dresses that were laid out on her bed.</p><p>"Do none of them really suit your taste?" Queen Alicent asked as Levana nodded shyly. With a small sigh, the Queen gestured for the handmaidens to fetch the other dresses made for the Princess.</p><p>"Levana, the feast will begin soon and we can't spend the entire day choosing a dress."</p><p>"What is Aemond wearing, Your Grace?" Levana asked, "if I cannot choose, I will choose one that would match him."</p><p>Queen Alicent smiled, "Levana, he is supposed to match with you," she responded, "it's your Name Day."</p><p>"Why not a sea green color?" Queen Alicent suggested, "to match with your Velaryon heritage."</p><p>Levana thought for a while. It was a color that her father always wore.</p><p>"Do we have a dress in gold?" Levana asked, "I know Grandsire would be wearing something of the sort!"</p><p>Just as Queen Alicent was about to stand to check on the dresses, Galatea came rushing in with a gold dress in hand. Levana's eyes widened at the sight and hopped off her dressing stool to approach her handmaiden who held out the dress to the princess with a smile.</p><p>"Where did this come from?" Queen Alicent asked as Levana took the dress from Galatea and stood in front of the mirror.</p><p>"It came from Princess Rhaenys, my Queen," Galatea began, "she said it was a dress that she had made for the princess."</p><p>Queen Alicent took a look at the dress and furrowed her brows. It was familiar to her but she couldn't seem to remember where she had seen it before.</p><p>"Can I please wear this?" Levana asked, "will Aemond be able to match if I wore this?"</p><p>Queen Alicent nodded, "I believe he does have attire of the same color."</p><p>Levana smiled brightly as she got back up on her dressing stool and held the dress out, "I would like to wear this dress, please!"</p><p>Queen Alicent took one look at the younger girl and nodded with a smile. She then looked towards Galatea, "please make sure that the princess is ready soon, I'll go see my son."</p><p>Galatea bowed her head as the Queen walked out of the room. Galatea turned towards Levana and noticed that the little girl was gone from her dressing stool. The dress was on the bed but the princess was nowhere to be found.</p><p>"Princess Levana!"</p><p>Galatea ran towards the bathroom to find the princess but she wasn't there. Rushing back into the room, she noticed that the princess was crouched by one of the couches with her knees to her chest.</p><p>"Princess, we have to get you ready."</p><p>Levana turned to Galatea and shook her head.</p><p>"Princess, you heard the Queen, the feast will begin soon."</p><p>Galatea held her hand out for the princess but the latter refused. Instead, Levana stood up and made a run for the bath, closing the door behind her and locking it.</p><p>"Princess!"</p><p>Galatea knocked frantically on the door but the princess didn't respond.</p><p>"Princess Levana, please tell me what's wrong!"</p><p>"Please leave me alone!"</p><p>The handmaiden kept knocking and urging the princess to leave the bath but the younger female was adamant to stay inside. The commotion had caught the attention of the princess' sworn protector who came rushing into the room.</p><p>"Princess Levana," Ser Westerling called from outside the bath, "please open the door."</p><p>"No!" Levana shouted in response.</p><p>Galatea and Ser Westerling continued to try and urge the princess to remove herself from the bath but the younger female was adamant to stay inside. The two would continue to urge the princess to leave the bath but it was to no avail.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>The festivities for the feast began without a hitch.

</p><p> </p><p>The Velaryons made their way to the table as the doors would continue to open to reveal Rhaenyra's family this time. While the crowd continued to cheer for the arrival of the princess, the royal family was not as excited about their arrival.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>Rhaenyra and her family took their place on the table; the princess nodded towards her family to which the king reciprocated with a nod of acknowledgment. The family remained standing as the doors would open again to finally reveal Prince Aemond standing alone.</p><p>Queen Alicent looked at the prince with worry and made her way toward Aemond.</p><p>"Where's Levana?" Queen Alicent whispered as she looked around. The Queen was shocked to see Galatea frantically running towards the hall.</p><p>"Where's the Princess?" Queen Alicent asked as Galatea took a deep breath, pointing to the direction of the princess's room. By instinct, Queen Alicent ran in the direction of Levana's room where Ser Westerling was still knocking on the door, trying to ease the princess into coming out.</p><p>"My Queen," Ser Westerling addressed Queen Alicent who rushed into the room.</p><p>"Princess Levana locked herself inside the bath," Ser Westerling stated, "according to Galatea, she wouldn't come out and it's been hours."</p><p>"Levana," Queen Alicent knocked on the door, "what's happened, child?"</p><p>"It's embarrassing, Queen Alicent," Levana responded. The Queen could make out that the princess had been crying because of the way she sounded.</p><p>"Will you let me in, Levana?" Queen Alicent requested as the door opened, Levana peeked outside the door. The Queen let out a sigh of relief as the princess seemed to be okay, however, there was an unmistakable scent that quickly filled the Queen's nose.</p><p>Queen Alicent looked at the princess to see a bloodied gown.</p><p>"Galatea," Queen Alicent called, "please give the princess another bath and prepare a fresh set of her inner clothes."</p><p>Galatea nodded and made her way into the bath. Queen Alicent then turned to Ser Westerling who bowed his head slightly, "please call for the maesters," the Queen stated as the knight nodded and made his way out of the room.</p><p>"Levana, I will talk to you before we head to the feast." The Queen stated as she took a seat on the princess' bed, eyeing the dress that she chose. She was still trying to decipher where she first saw it but she still couldn't put a finger on it.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, the princess was already dressed and Galatea had just finished fixing her hair. The princess remained silent throughout the whole ordeal - especially so when Galatea left the room.</p><p>"Levana, I want you to know that what happened to you is normal," Queen Alicent stated as she took the princess' hand in hers, "bleeding only means that you've become a lady."</p><p>"What will people think of me?" Levana asked, "is this typical for a princess?"</p><p>Queen Alicent smiled in amusement, "it's normal for all females," she stated, "all women bleed when they have become women."</p><p>"Am I still pure?"</p><p>The question made Queen Alicent worried before embracing her, "yes, you are but at this point, you must be more careful."</p><p>Levana wrapped her arms around the Queen and sobbed into her chest, "it's okay, Levana, you are okay," the older female assured.</p><p>"The people are waiting for you," Queen Alicent stated as she broke the embrace and held the princess' hand tightly.</p><p>Although she was unsure of herself, Queen Alicent escorted the princess to the dining hall.

</p><p> </p><p>Levana walked alongside Aemond, her heart pounding against her chest as she saw her entire family waiting for her at the end of the table. Time seemed to be slower and so was Aemond - so much so that Levana wanted to run towards the table to end the entire ordeal but her betrothed held her hand tightly and smiled at her.</p><p>"Relax," Aemond whispered, "I'm here."</p><p>The princess's expression softened as she nodded at him. They finished the march towards the table and after bowing to their family, Aemond and Levana were allowed to take their seats at the table. Levana sat at the right of the king along with her parents while the prince sat with his family at the king's left.</p><p>"Are you alright, love?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana nodded.</p><p>"Do you need a maester, Ana?" Jacaerys whispered from beside their mother as the princess shook her head.</p><p>"I'm fine, I promise."</p><p>With that, the crowd's attention turned to King Viserys who cleared his throat and glanced at his family as well as the people who gathered at the dining hall.</p><p>"Be welcome as we join together in celebration," King Viserys began, "the festivities of the last few days have led us to this grand feast to honor my first grandchild, Princess Levana."</p><p>The crowd clapped as the king gestured towards Levana who stood up and bowed at the crowd before smiling.</p><p>"It was become a Targaryen family tradition, from Levana's birth, to gaze upon the Harvest Moon that is at its highest during her Name Day," The king continued, "tonight, we share this tradition with everyone as I invite you all to come to the Godswood after the feast to watch as the moon reaches its peak."</p><p>The crowd cheered as Levana took a seat. The king gestured for the crowd to settle before looking at his cousin, Princess Rhaenys with a sad expression, "by request of Princess Levana, we also honor the late Ser Laenor Velaryon, my granddaughter's father."</p><p>Levana looked down at her lap and pursed her lips. This would be her first Name Day without her father and she longed to have his presence with her.</p><p>"Tonight, we also formally announce the betrothal of Princess Levana Velaryon to my son, Prince Aemond Targaryen as we once again unite the two houses to herald in a new age of dragons."</p><p>The crowd cheered its loudest as Levana smiled and looked over to Aemond who glanced at her before quickly turning his head toward the crowd. The king would then take a seat before walking gesturing towards Princess Rhaenyra who stood up from her chair and looked towards the crowd.</p><p>"I admit," Princess Rhaenyra began, "this is nostalgic as I have also been in my daughter's place in such a grand celebration such as this."</p><p>The crowd settled down slightly as the princess looked at her daughter, "please allow me to read a letter from my late husband addressed to our daughter for this day."</p><p>Princess Rhaenyra picked up an envelope from the table and opened it to reveal a letter that she unraveled.</p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>To my beloved daughter,</p>
<p>I look at you every day and I grow prouder of you as every second passes by. I watch you grow and I couldn't be happier that the gods have given me a daughter who was born with a heart and mind such as yours.</p>
<p>You are the best sister to your brothers and the best daughter born to us. I know that your mother is just as proud of you as I am - maybe even prouder. I believe that you will grow into the woman that will unite the seven realms and rule just as your Grandsire and your mother after him.</p>
<p>Carry with you the wisdom of your grandsires and the love of your grandmothers. You are born of the blood of Old Valyria, carry this proudly.</p>
<p>I am always with you.</p>
<p>With all my love,</p>
<p>Your father, Laenor Velaryon</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>Levana couldn't stop herself from tearing up. Jacaerys and Lucerys got up from their seats to embrace their older sister. Rhaenys and Corlys looked at each other before glancing at their grandchildren.</p><p>"Your father wrote this for you during your last Name Day," Rhaenyra explained, "it was his wish to give this to you the next time the Harvest Moon took to the skies," she continued before handing the letter to Levana who sobbed as she accepted it.</p><p>
<b>This was her father's last gift to her.</b>
</p><p>"We would also like to bestow a gift to Princess Levana," Otto stated as he stood up from his chair.</p><p>"On behalf of my family, House Hightower, I present to the Princess this necklace," Otto continued as he opened a box to present to the crowd, "made of Valyrian steel, rubies, and emeralds to honor your Name Day."</p><p>The Hand of the King walked towards the princess and placed the box in front of her before retreating back to his seat. Levana gave him a small nod of acknowledgment as she held her brothers' hands in hers.</p><p>The Queen would stand soon after, "Princess Levana, in the few months that she has lived with us, has become like a child to me and the king," she stated, "as such, we would like to bestow a special gift to the princess and to her betrothed."</p><p>King Viserys nodded before standing as well, he picked up a box from in front of him and opened it to reveal two rings.</p><p>"These rings belonged to myself and my late wife, Queen Aemma," King Viserys began, "I think of no other pair fitting to wear them than the two of you."</p><p>"These will be the rings that you'll wear on your wedding day," Queen Alicent stated, "and the rings that will unite the two of you in matrimony."</p><p>Alicent placed a hand on Aemond's shoulder as Rhaenyra placed a kiss on the top of Levana's head.</p><p>"Let the feast begin!" King Viserys announced happily before returning to his seat. The Queen and the Princess would also take their seats. Lucerys and Jacaerys stayed by their sister's side, embracing her tightly as the princess glanced through the letter over and over.</p><p>The crowd had begun to gather on the dance floor as the music played. Lord Corlys stood up from his seat and walked towards Levana, offering his hand to her.</p><p>"Might I have a dance with you, granddaughter?" Lord Corlys asked as Levana tucked her father's letter in a pocket hidden within the skirt of her dress before getting up from her seat and nodding. She took her Grandsire's hand in hers. Lord Corlys would then lead her to the dance floor where the crowd made space for them.</p><p>"I hope you don't mind, little ocean," Lord Corlys began, "but your grandmother and I already gave our present to you in advance."</p><p>Levana looked at her dress and shook her head, "thank you for the dress, Grandsire, it's very beautiful."</p><p>Lord Corlys smiled, "that dress was made from the fabric of the clothes that your father wore when he married your mother."</p><p>The princess held back tears.</p><p>"Your father loved you very much, Levana," Lord Corlys whispered as the princess wrapped her arms around his waist. The sea snake placed a hand on top of her head, stroking her hair as the princess cried.</p><p>"May I cut in?"</p><p>Levana looked up to see her <em>stepfather</em>, Daemon Targaryen, standing behind her grandfather. Lord Corlys looked at the princess and then at Daemon with a glare before stepping aside, "of course, you are Levana's <em>stepfather </em>after all."</p><p>Lord Corlys placed another kiss on top of Levana's head before nodding at Daemon who took the princess's hand in his. The younger girl kept her head down as she followed his movements.</p><p>"You need not be shy around me, stepdaughter," Daemon stated, "I also have a duty to protect you."</p><p>Levana looked up at him and nodded.</p><p><em>"I believe that I have not introduced myself formally to you,"</em> Daemon began, <em>"I am Prince Daemon Targaryen, your Grandsire's younger brother."</em></p><p>Levana's eyes lit up, it's been a while since someone spoke to her in High Valyrian.</p><p><em>"My name is Levana,"</em> Levana smiled as Daemon nodded.</p><p><em>"You speak Valyrian very well," </em>Daemon commended, <em>"when did you start learning?"</em></p><p><em>"I started learning when I was six," </em>Levana explained, <em>"father always told mother that it was too early for me to learn it at that age but I think it was very much worth it."</em></p><p>Daemon smiled slightly, <em>"your mother is very proud of you, I want you to know that."</em></p><p>Levana nodded as the music ended and the crowd clapped before the band started a new piece.</p><p><em>"What do I call you?" </em>Levana asked, <em>"you are married to my mother."</em></p><p>Daemon chuckled, <em>"you are not asked to call me anything."</em></p><p>
<em>"But you are my stepfather."</em>
</p><p><em>"You may call me that, if you wish," </em>Daemon stated, <em>"but you can also call me by name."</em></p><p><em>"You will not think it rude?" </em>Levana asked as Daemon nodded, <em>"I will not and you have my permission," </em>he responded as the princess smiled at him.</p><p>From her seat, Princess Rhaenys watched Daemon dancing with Levana. The sight left a bad taste in her mouth.</p><p>That should've been Laenor dancing with her — not someone else.</p><p>"Princess Rhaenys," Queen Alicent called from her seat, "if you do not find it disrespectful, might I ask where you acquired Levana's dress?"</p><p>Princess Rhaenys raised a brow, "why would you be interested to know, Your Grace?"</p><p>Queen Alicent smiled, "it looks familiar but I cannot remember where I saw it first."</p><p>The older princess chuckled before glancing at Rhaenyra and then looking towards Levana, "it was made from the garment that Laenor wore during his wedding."</p><p>Rhaenyra, upon hearing what Rhaenys said, immediately looked down at her lap — pretending that she didn't hear as she turned towards her sons, fussing over them.</p><p>Rhaenys saw this and smiled to herself slightly as Queen Alicent nodded a response. She didn't know how to feel about it but at the very least, she was happy that Levana got the chance to wear something from her father.</p><p>"Aemond," Queen Alicent turned to his son, "why don't you dance with Levana?"</p><p>The prince looked up at his mother and shook his head. The queen then furrowed her brows, "why not?"</p><p>"She's dancing with her father."</p><p>"You can take her from him."</p><p>Aemond turned to his mother before pushing himself away from the table and getting up to walk to the dance floor. He approached Daemon and Levana with a small glare.</p><p>"May I dance with her?" Aemond spoke up as Daemon looked at him and chuckled, "and if I say no?"</p><p>Levana's eyes widened at her stepfather's response, "I will dance with you, Aemond."</p><p>Daemon grinned as he stepped aside to allow Levana to join Aemond. Before returning to the table he looked at the two of them and leaned down to whisper to his stepdaughter.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

<p>The entire night was filled with laughter and joy but Levana was <em>bothered </em>by what her stepfather had told her. In fact, she couldn't look toward him at all after that encounter.</p><p>Just who was she <em>not </em>supposed to trust?</p><p>The question continued to bother her until it was time for everyone to head to the Godswood to watch the Harvest Moon. Levana, of course, was walking ahead of everyone with Jacaerys and Lucerys by her side. The two were talking nonstop about how the moon was bright and beautiful.</p><p>When they arrived at the Godswood, the moon was already at its peak. The large moon illuminated the sky and the princess couldn't help but marvel at its beauty.</p><p>Levana found herself getting entranced by the moon as it glowed brightly. It was as if the Harvest Moon was telling her a story - enticing her to listen.</p><p>In her trance, Levana once again found herself in the same castle that she had seen a few moons ago.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>
<em>The castle, though still unfamiliar to the princess, was bustling with people. They were all faces she didn't recognize until she again found herself in a hall where the Painted Table was erected.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Compared to her previous vision, this table glowed brighter. Levana could also see the presence of golden banners in the room. It was a sight to see but she still wished she knew what her vision was telling her.</em>
</p><p>
<em>There was a mighty roar that interrupted her train of thought — one that she recognized to be Vermithor's. Quickly, she rushed towards the hall to gaze upon her dragon soaring through the sky with two others.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Make way for the Queen!"</em>
</p><p>
<em>Levana turned her end to the end of the hall where the female that she saw in her first vision stood. She was dressed in red and gold riding gear as she walked through the hall with what Levana could only distinguish as a Queensguard in tow.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just as the figure was about to pass her, she stopped and looked down at the princess.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"</em>
<b>
<em>The moon of your grandmother's vision will rise, Levana."</em>
</b>
</p><p><em>Levana was taken aback as everything turned</em> <em>dark.</em></p><p>
<em>What vision? What did her grandmother see?</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━<em><br/></em></p><p> </p><p>Levana realized that she was out of her trance when she was met with gentle slaps to the face by Princess Rhaenys. She was laying on the ground, her torso propped up by Rhaenyra who was ordering for the maesters. Lord Corlys was summoning guards that could help take Levana back to her chambers.</p><p>"Levana!" Rhaenyra called, "come back to us, beloved."</p><p>Levana blinked her eyes twice to see that she was being fussed over by what seemed to be her <em>entire family</em>. Jacaerys and Lucerys were looking from a distance, the latter was crying as Rhaena and Baela tried to console them.</p><p>King Viserys and Otto were repeatedly calling for the maesters while the Queen was in the process of rallying Levana's handmaidens to help her find lighter clothing. Rhaenys and Rhaenyra remained by her side as she started to come to.</p><p>Aemond was also there but he was silent; looking over Rhaenyra's shoulder as he watched the scene unfold. Daemon was talking to one of the maesters that came early — by what Levana could make out from their conversation, her stepfather was asking about what could have happened to her.</p><p>"Levana, are you alright, darling?" Princess Rhaenys asked as Levana nodded and sat up. The older princess immediately wrapped her arms around her tightly, "I thought we lost you," she whispered as Levana wrapped her arms around her grandmother.</p><p>"Little moon, are you alright?" King Viserys asked, "what happened to you?"</p><p>Levana wasn't so sure if she could tell her family what her vision was but fortunately, her mother had cut in when the maester asked what happened.</p><p>"She was just looking at the moon," Rhaenyra stated, "her eyes turned white and she fell to the ground."</p><p>"How long was she unresponsive?" The maester asked as Rhaenys looked up at him, "a couple of minutes but she has never done this before."</p><p>"Princess Rhaenys is right," Queen Alicent seconded, "Levana has never shown this type of behavior in the months that she's been with us and she watches the moon with Aemond most evenings."</p><p>"Has she done this before, Princess Rhaenyra?" The maester asked as Rhaenyra thought for a while.</p><p>"I've seen her in a trance before," Rhaenyra stated, "but she did not faint like this nor did her eyes turn white."</p><p>"When did this happen?" Queen Alicent asked.</p><p>"The day that she claimed Vermithor," Rhaenyra responded, "she was flying on her dragon and she seemed to be in a trance for a few moments but she easily recovered back then."</p><p>"Princess Levana," One of the maesters called, "how do you feel?"</p><p>Levana shrugged, "I feel fine," she responded, "I don't feel anything."</p><p>"Are you sure?" The maester asked as Lord Corlys knelt beside the princess, "Levana, tell us the truth."</p><p>Levana nodded, "I don't feel anything, honest."</p><p>"I think it best if the princess is allowed to retire and rest for the remainder of the evening," Queen Alicent stated as King Viserys nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Allow me to escort the princess to her chambers," Rhaenyra stated as the King and Queen nodded. The two were led away by Galatea as the rest of their family remained in Godswood.</p><p>"You are all invited to return to the hall for the remainder of the feast," King Viserys stated, "please, there is still more food to eat and more wine to drink."</p><p>The guests cheered as they emptied the Godswood to return to the Grand Hall. On the other hand, Rhaenyra had just settled with Levana in the latter's chambers as Galatea helped the princess to get dressed in her nightgown.</p><p>"What happened, Ana?" Princess Rhaenyra asked as Levana looked at her mother before puffing her cheeks and thanking her handmaiden.</p><p>"Would you be needing anything else, Princess Levana?" Galatea asked as the princess shook her head.</p><p>"Enjoy the night, Galatea."</p><p>The handmaiden nodded and excused herself, closing the door behind her as Rhaenyra turned to her daughter, "I will not ask twice, Ana."</p><p>Levana huffed, "do you get visions mother?"</p><p>"What visions?" Rhaenyra asked.</p><p>"I've had two in the past months," Levana began, "one during my first flight with Vermithor and the other was earlier tonight."</p><p>"What did you see?" Rhaenyra asked, "have you told anyone else about this?"</p><p>Levana shook her head, "I'm afraid that they might think me sick if I told anyone about it."</p><p>"What did your visions show you, Ana?"</p><p>The younger princess took a deep breath, "I suspect both my visions to be in the same stronghold, they had the same Painted Table but I could never distinguish which castle it was that I was in," she stated as her mother listened intently, "each time, I would see someone wearing a golden crown with rubies in it."</p><p>Rhaenyra raised a brow, "Ana, this isn't one of your made-up stories, is it?"</p><p>Levana shook her head adamantly, "it's true, mother!"</p><p>"Go on," Rhaenyra sighed.</p><p>"I would hear people talking in the visions but I could never understand them or hear what they had to say," Levana sighed, "but I always remember that figure being referred to as the Queen."</p><p>"What else did you see?"</p><p>"I saw Vermithor with two other dragons," Levana continued, "one was a pale gray and the other was as black as night."</p><p>"Were there other dragons?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana shook her head.</p><p>"I only saw Vermithor and those two others," Levana responded, "but in my vision, I could hear more growling and roaring."</p><p>Rhaenyra marveled at her daughter's vision - thinking it to be a sign of the future that would come with their reign.</p><p>"You must rest," Rhaenyra stated, "you've had a long night."</p><p>Levana nodded as she walked towards her bed as the older princess motioned toward the door, opening it slightly when Levana spoke, "will you be here when I wake up tomorrow, mother?"</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled before walking towards her and placing a kiss on her forehead, "I will be here when you wake up and then again when you sleep tomorrow evening."</p><p>Levana smiled at her mother's gesture before tucking herself into bed.</p><p>"See you in the morning, mother."</p><p>Rhaenyra nodded, "I will see you in the morn, my love." </p>

</p><p> </p><p>The memory of her tenth Name Day would be one that became a distant memory as many moons passed through the sky.</p><p>Though, the memory of her visions would remain to be a continued sight in the princess' dreams. The visions would come and go - they'd become more frequent as the princess became older but she would have little to no memory of the other visions that she saw as she matured no matter how vivid they would be.</p><p>Still, what would not leave her is the memory of the figure wearing a gold crown adorned with rubies and the sight of her dragon flying with two others.</p><p>Levana supposed that it would be better for her to forget them. After all, it was only the King who heard her stories about her visions as she grew - her mother dismissed them when she reached the age of ten and four. Urging her that it would be best if her moonlit visions are forgotten and done with.</p><p>The princess was now ten and seven, practicing embroidery alongside her aunt, Helaena. The two have become closer as the years went by. Levana saw her as someone that she could confide in with no question.</p><p>"Your embroidery is beautiful, Levana," Helaena commented, "you've embroidered the Godswood exquisitely."</p><p>Levana turned to her and smiled, "thank you, Helaena," she said as she looked at her piece, "your embroidery is just as exquisite."</p><p>"I'm sure that your future children with Aemond would be glad to have you as a mother," Helaena smiled, "you would be able to embroider such beautiful cloths."</p><p>Levana smiled at the thought though it pained her.</p><p>As they grew, Aemond and her would grow distant from each other. Maybe it was due to their varying interests as the prince now also allotted time to the sword while Levana spent her time with the Queen and Helaena.</p><p>While they did find common ground in reading and dragon riding, it was simply not the same as they would only exchange a few words with each other. Levana thought it to be normal as they had to keep their distance as with custom but this was surely too much as they were such good friends prior to this.</p><p>"Speaking of Aemond," The Queen cut in, "I wonder where he is about."</p><p>Levana sighed, "I believe he was in the library earlier today as he was with Septon Salvi."</p><p>Queen Alicent noticed the discomfort in Levana's tone and placed a hand on her shoulder, "he will come around, Levana."</p><p>Levana turned to the Queen and smiled, "Your Grace, I do not wish to bother Aemond with this yet as we both have priorities and duties about us that we need to care for."</p><p>"But you are his betrothed," Queen Alicent stated, "it is also his duty to make sure that you are safe, well, and protected."</p><p>"I require no protection from the prince, Your Grace."</p><p>"Levana, my sweet daughter," The Queen sighed, "I refuse to have this argument with you again."</p><p>This, as a matter of fact, was not the first that they had argued about the duties of Aemond to Levana. The princess was content with the distance between them as she is quite capable of holding her own but Queen Alicent believes that Aemond should be available at all times to aid the princess.</p><p>Just as Levana was about to reply, the doors to the Queen's chamber opened to reveal Aemond. The prince bowed his head slightly at the ladies in front of him and turned his attention to the princess.</p><p>"Mother," Aemond said, "I ask to have a moment with Princess Levana."</p><p>The Queen chuckled, "it is not I that you should be asking permission from."</p><p>"Princess," Aemond held his hand out, "I would like to request for your company in the Godswood."</p><p>"Pray tell what are we to discuss there that we cannot discuss in the presence of Queen Mother and Helaena?" Levana smiled as the prince chuckled a response, "'tis a matter that I wish to discuss with my betrothed."</p><p>Queen Alicent looked at his son and then at Levana before smiling, "very well then, Levana, you may go."</p><p>The princess nodded and stood up from her seat, leaving her embroidery on the table before taking Aemond's hand and walking out of the room. Ser Westerling followed closely behind them as he is accustomed to</p><p>"I do wish that your sworn protector would leave distance between himself and us," Aemond whispered, "this is a delicate matter that I wish to discuss with you."</p><p>Levana nodded and turned to face the knight who had a brow raised, "if you are to tell me to leave, Princess Levana, I will refuse as ordered by King Viserys."</p><p>"I simply wish for a safe distance, Ser Westerling," Levana responded, "Aemond and I are to discuss a delicate and personal matter."</p><p>Ser Westerling sighed before nodding his head, "a safe distance is what you will receive, Your Grace."</p><p>With that, the two royals would proceed to the Godswood while Ser Westerling stayed by the castle door, watching as the two walked farther from him and nearer to the Weirwood tree.</p><p>"What do you wish to discuss, Aemond?"</p><p>"A matter of our betrothal," Aemond began, "I wish to have it broken."</p><p>Levana was taken aback, "does the Queen and King know about this?"</p><p>"They do not need to know unless we have decided," Aemond stated, "you do not wish to live a loveless marriage, do you?"</p><p>The princess raised a brow, "Aemond, what do you know about love and what I feel toward you?"</p><p>"I know that you do not love me," Aemond stated, "and whatever feelings I may have for you will wither away with the end of our betrothal."</p><p>"I refuse."</p><p>"Do not make this hard, Eva."</p><p>"How dare you assume my feelings for you and ask for this?" Levana asked, "we've prepared our entire lives for us to be wed, Aemond."</p><p>"You're not supposed to prepare for marriage for that long, I know that now," Aemond responded as Levana held back tears, "I refused to set foot on Dragonstone again to be with you."</p><p>"Levana, we were children."</p><p>"You would rather see me marry a different lord?" Levana asked, "a lord that I do not know?"</p><p>Aemond shook his head, "I am protecting you this way, Levana."</p><p>"From what, Aemond?!" Levana raised her voice enough to alert Ser Westerling who proceeded to walk towards them.</p><p>"Princess," Ser Westerling, "perhaps you should retreat to your chambers."</p><p>Levana raised a hand, <em>"what are you protecting me from, Aemond?"</em></p><p><em>"It is better if you do not know, Levana,"</em> Aemond stated, <em>"you will be kept safer that way."</em></p><p><em>"What is it that I should not know about you, Aemond?"</em> Levana asked, <em>"we are friends, are we not? You can share this burden </em><em>with</em><em> me."</em></p><p><em>"No,"</em> Aemond replied bluntly, <em>"Levana, this is the only way to protect my honor and yours."</em></p><p><em><b>"The King and the Queen will know about this,"</b></em> Levana warned before running back into the palace. Ser Westerling turned to bow at the prince before following after the princess.</p>

<p>Rumors were meant to be kept as whispers in the halls. But no matter how silent the whispers were, Levana still heard them and they haunted her so.</p><p>They began as hushed whispers in the courtyard before moving up to be echoes in the Red Keep's hallowed halls. Levana wished that she could be away from them and forget but it wasn't that easy — especially when her future with Aemond was on the line.</p><p>Still, the rumor had her at wit's end which prompted her to sneak out of the palace in the dead of night. She found herself in the streets of King's Landing in search of someone who many know as the <em>White Worm</em>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Aemond was in the company of his parents and Grandsire in the safety of the council chamber. The prince made his intentions clear to those present and his elders looked at him disappointedly.</p><p>"If the rumors are true," Otto began, "the earlier your wedding must happen."</p><p>"I will not marry Levana," Aemond stated, "her honor is worth more than this engagement."</p><p>"You dishonor her by even thinking about ending your engagement!" Queen Alicent interjected as her son shook his head.</p><p>The Queen sighed, "she has not been sleeping nor eating properly."</p><p>"Does she know?" Aemond asked, "has someone told her about the rumors?"</p><p>King Viserys turned to his youngest son and nodded, "nobody has to tell Levana," he stated, "she has her ways of finding out on her own."</p><p>"Then you will accept my request, father?" Aemond asked as King Viserys chuckled a response.</p><p>"You mean to break an engagement over a baseless rumor?" King Viserys laughed, "you will have to fight me to the death before I allow it."</p><p>For a while, Aemond considered his father's challenge. He was a capable fighter but he also imagined that he wouldn't take it to such extremes.</p><p>"Aemond," Queen Alicent began, "Levana loves you and gods forbid that you deny that you feel the same about her."</p><p>"Mother—"</p><p>"We are not blind, Aemond," Queen Alicent added, "you do not look at anyone the way that you look at Levana and the way that you act around her is vastly different."</p><p>"And if the rumors are true?" Aemond asked, "what of it then?"</p><p>"The Crown denies all rumors that relate to you and Daemon Targaryen," Otto stated, "such a rumor is an act of treason to House Targaryen, and whoever spread it will be found and punished."</p><p>"Meanwhile, you will reconcile with Levana," Queen Alicent stated, "and you will take back what you said about breaking your betrothal."</p><p>"She deserves more than everything that I have to give," Aemond began, "she will be the Queen."</p><p>King Viserys looked at his son and sighed, "Aemond, you are a prince of the House of the Dragon," he began, "no other prince or lord in the Seven Realms can compare to what you have and what you will give to your betrothed."</p><p>With that, Aemond nodded and excused himself from the table - he would need to find Levana and make his amends before the princess truly decided to break their engagement because of his actions.</p><p>"Galatea," Aemond called as he approached Levana's chambers, "is Eva inside?"</p><p>Galatea bowed to the prince and nodded, "she hasn't been coming out for the past few days and even Princess Helaena is worried for her."</p><p>For the first time in his life, Aemond felt absolutely <em>stupid</em>.</p><p>"Eva," Aemond knocked but was met with no response.</p><p>Worried that something might have happened to her, Aemond, quite literally, kicked the door open to reveal an empty chamber.</p><p>"Eva!"</p><p>Aemond must've looked through all of the corners in Levana's chambers but she was still not in sight.</p><p>"Where is Ser Westerling?" Aemond asked, turning to Galatea who looked just as worried as the prince.</p><p>"Ser Harold was asked to tend to the King today, my Prince," Galatea responded, "I was preparing the princess' meal."</p><p>Aemond looked through the papers on Levana's desk, stopping at the sight of a name that he had heard the servants talking about.</p><p>
<em>White Worm.</em>
</p><p>He grabbed the piece of paper as he walked out of the room, "get me Ser Criston and alert the City Watch that the princess is in King's Landing."</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>In the years that she's lived in the Red Keep, she has never been outside its walls to see what has become of King's Landing.</p><p>It was unsightly, to say the least.</p><p>The princess found herself wandering through the alleys - not that she knew where she was supposed to go. All she had was a name to go by and she knew better than to ask around as someone might even recognize her if she said anything.</p><p>"Hey, lady," a voice called.</p><p>Levana turned around to see a small child looking up at her.</p><p>"She knows that you're looking for her," the child stated as he stretched his hand out, "I'll take you to her."</p><p>"To whom, exactly?"</p><p>"To my mistress."</p><p>"Mistress?" Levana asked, "who?"</p><p>"The one that you're looking for," the child responded.</p><p>Before she knew it, she had accepted the child's hand and they were making their way through the back alleys of King's Landing before retreating to a staircase in a building that Levana didn't even recognize where.</p><p>"It's been a while since I've had Targaryen royalty under my roof."</p><p>"Are you the White Worm?" Levana asked as the figure in front of her turned around to face her.</p><p>"You look so much like your stepfather," the White Worm stated, "are you sure you're not his?"</p><p>"I have Velaryon blood," Levana stated, "and it runs true."</p><p>The White Worm smiled at her and gestured for her to take a seat on one of the chairs in the room. The princess would then take a seat, trying to formulate her sentences as the other female sat in front of her.</p><p>"Most people come to me if they wish to know something," the other female stated, "do you come for the same purpose?"</p><p>Levana nodded, "I need to know who began the rumors about Prince Aemond."</p><p>"Does the prince know that you have come to me to defend his honor?"</p><p>The princess shook his head, "he does not need to know," she stated, "I am doing this for him."</p><p>The White Worm looked at her with an amused expression, "are you in love with the prince?"</p><p>"I don't know," Levana responded, "I can't tell."</p><p>"The fact that you are here says a lot," The older female stated, "no one in their right mind would escape from the castle in broad daylight if they did not care for the person that they are speaking for."</p><p>"Will you help me?" Levana asked, "even if Aemond does decide to break our betrothal, I would at least want to put his mind at ease."</p><p>"Very well, princess," the White Worm smiled, "but it comes with a price."</p><p>Levana nodded and produced a small bag of gold from the pocket of her cloak, "will this suffice?"</p><p>"I am not robbing you, princess," the female chuckled, "because you have been such a nice guest, you can name your price."</p><p>"But I'm asking you for a service," Levana stated, "shouldn't you be naming the price for it?"</p><p>"Cunning and respectful," the White Worm smiled, "the mark of a princess."</p><p>Levana smiled at her as she held out the bag for the woman to take. The White Worm nodded and took the bag in her hands, opening it and taking a couple of pieces from the bag.</p><p>"You may call me Mysaria, my princess."</p><p>"Is that your name?"</p><p>Mysaria nodded as she returned the bag to the princess and stood up to take a piece of paper from her desk. She would then scribble something down before handing it to the princess.</p><p>"You will find the name of your traitor there," Mysaria stated as Levana took the piece of paper and hit it in the secret pocket of her dress skirt.</p><p>"The child outside will escort you back to the palace," Mysaria smiled.</p><p>The princess nodded and bowed her head.</p><p>"If you need me again, princess, you know where to find me now."</p><p>Levana nodded and left the place, looking around for the little boy who escorted her through the streets but he was nowhere to be found. Instead, the princess decided for herself to try and locate her way back to the palace.</p><p> </p><p>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Aemond insisted on accompanying Ser Westerling to look for his betrothed in King's Landing and despite protests from the Queen, the prince would still have his way.</p><p>"Why do you think the princess would look for the White Worm, my prince?" Ser Criston asked as Aemond held up the piece of paper she found in Levana's room, "she was trying to find whoever began those rumors about my parentage."</p><p>"Forgive me, My Prince, but how sure are you of this?" Ser Criston asked as Aemond stopped in his tracks.</p><p>"I know Eva too well," Aemond responded, "we've spent too much time together for me not to know what she is like."</p><p>Ser Westerling listened to the exchange with an amused smile, "they were inseparable when they were growing up."</p><p>Ser Criston was about to respond when a commotion in the square caught their attention. Immediately, the knights of the City Watch rushed toward the scene, Aemond following after them.</p><p>The brawl was getting larger by the second and the City Watch had to summon more of their men to break it apart. Aemond looked around to try and find Levana and as it turns out, he didn't need to look too far.</p><p>"Aemond!"</p><p>Aemond rushed toward the center of the brawl, finding Levana easily enough.</p><p>"Damsel in distress does not suit you, Eva," Aemond chuckled as he wrapped an arm around Levana's shoulders, maneuvering their way out of the brawl.</p><p>Ser Westerling spotted and quickly summoned the City Watch to surround the prince and the princess for them to be escorted safely back to the palace. The City Watch made sure that the prince and princess were hauled into the carriage that waited for them before breaking up the brawl.</p><p>Aemond kept Levana close to him as they boarded the carriage. The two sat beside each other as the princess leaned her head against the prince's shoulder. Aemond held her tightly as the carriage made its way back to the castle.</p><p>"I hope you found what you were looking for," Aemond whispered as Levana nodded.</p><p>Levana hummed, "it was a fruitful visit to the city, that's for sure." </p>

<p>Upon their return to the Red Keep, it was expected that they were to be met with a scolding - especially Levana who had taken it upon herself to “find justice” for Aemond. When all that was said and done, Levana found herself in the solace of her room where she would finally find out who it was who began the rumors about Aemond in the first place. </p><p>Taking a deep breath, Levana unraveled the paper. Immediately, she felt as though her heart would escape from her chest.</p><p><em>Daemon Targaryen</em>.</p><p>Her own stepfather. </p><p>But why?</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the opening of her door to reveal Aemond and Galatea who had a tray of tea in her hands. The princess was quick to hide the piece of paper beneath the others that were on her desk before getting up and taking a seat on the couch.</p><p>“May I?” Aemond asked as Levana nodded as her handmaiden set the tea on the table before bowing. Galatea glanced at the princess before closing the door behind her. </p><p>“The rumor that’s been spread about me,” Aemond began as he took a seat opposite the princess, “it was that my true father was Daemon Targaryen and not the king.” </p><p>Levana nodded. She’s heard the rumors - a plethora of them even. </p><p>“If the rumors were true,” Aemond continued, “I would be a bastard and I didn’t want you to live with that embarrassment especially since I had called your brothers the same thing.” </p><p>“Aemond--” </p><p>“Let me finish, Eva.” </p><p>Levana nodded and poured tea for the both of them. She waited for the prince to continue his piece as she took her own cup in her hands. </p><p>“I didn’t want you to be married to a bastard.” </p><p>“Who says you were one?” Levana asked, “you are the son of King Viserys Targaryen and Queen Alicent.” </p><p>“Rumor or not it will affect your standing,” Aemond stated, “I will not have you live a life of trying to defend me.” </p><p>“Aemond,” Levana began, “Daemon has taken many things from me in this lifetime.” </p><p>Aemond nodded as he watched her intently. </p><p>“When you asked me to break our betrothal, I was distraught and I blamed it upon myself because I believed it to be not enough for you,” Levana stated as Aemond shook his head. </p><p>“Levana, you are more than enough,” Aemond said, “you are everything that I could ask for and more.” </p><p>Levana smiled and chuckled, “when I heard of the rumor and realized that you were trying to protect me from another bastard-related issue, I wanted to help you.” </p><p>“You didn’t have to.”</p><p>“I wanted to, Aemond.” </p><p>“But why?” </p><p>“My brothers, all three, had to grow up being called bastards,” Levana was starting to feel the tears in her eyes but she held them back, “I couldn’t do anything about it and I couldn’t do anything for them because I was just a child too.” </p><p>Aemond knew how much her brothers meant to her though that would never change how he saw and felt about them. Still, he had developed a certain amount of respect for them as they were a big part of Levana’s life. </p><p>“I heard the rumor about you and my stepfather,” Levana could feel the tears starting to stream out from her eyes, “I now had the means to help you, Aemond, and I wasn’t going to let that pass me by.” </p><p>“You didn’t have to go to extremes,” Aemond stated, “having you by my side was enough.”</p><p>“Aemond, you were asking to break our betrothal,” Levana said, “if I were married to someone else then, would I be able to stand by you?” </p><p>Levana was right and Aemond knew it. </p><p>“I love you, Aemond,” Levana confessed, “at first, it was something that I thought would fade as we grew older but it didn’t, and needless to say, it broke my heart when you asked for the betrothal to be broken.” </p><p>The prince was at a loss for words, instead, he sat by the princess’ side, wrapping his arms around her tightly. </p><p>“I couldn’t bear losing you, Aemond, especially to Daemon,” Levana stated, “he already took from me my mother, my siblings, and even my cousins.” </p><p>Levana was sobbing now and all Aemond could do was comfort her. </p><p>“I didn’t want Daemon to take  you away from me too, Aemond.” </p><p>Aemond let go of Levana and lifted her chin up to gaze upon her eyes. The prince wiped the tears from her cheeks before shifting slightly so he could kneel on the floor beside Levana who watched him intently. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Aemond began, “I do not know where to begin especially as I have caused you so much stress these past few days.” </p><p>“I beg for your forgiveness, Eva,” Aemond continued, “if you can find it in your heart that I have broken to accept me once more then I will do everything in my power to mend what I have broken.”</p><p>“Are you sincere with your apology, Aemond?” </p><p>“I am prepared to fight wars and lords for your hand if it would come to it, Levana Velaryon,” Aemond stated, “but I cannot and will not bear it if you are to wed someone else.” </p><p>“I’m sorry that I have hurt you,” Aemond said, taking her hand in his, “I am sorry that you had to do this on my behalf and I’m sorry that I would let your stepfather break us apart.” </p><p>Levana smiled, holding his hand, “I know you are sincere because I have not heard you apologize like this before,” she chuckled as Aemond did the same. </p><p>“I am prepared to work for your love again, Eva,” Aemond swore, “even if I have to pick it up from where we began.” </p><p>Levana shook her head and placed her other hand on the side of his cheek, “if you were to pick it up from the very beginning, I would have to wait nearly two decades to marry you.” </p><p>They both laughed at the princess’ statement. There was a short silence that followed before Levana looked into Aemond’s eye and smiled, “I would like for us to continue where we left off, Aemond.” </p><p>“Are you certain?” Aemond asked.</p><p>“You can earn my love again but I do not wish for us to go back to the very beginning,” Levana smiled as Aemond got up from the floor and sat beside her. The prince wrapped his arms around her and embraced her tightly. </p><p>“I love you, Levana.” </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Prince Aemond did well on his promise to earn back Princess Levana's love and trust in the year that they were preparing for marriage. While they maintained civil in the eyes of others, the two would retreat to the library to find time for themselves - still under the watchful eye of Ser Westerling but they were still glad to have time for them.</p><p>Queen Alicent and King Viserys were overjoyed that the two of them would continue their engagement and began to plan the wedding immediately. Sending invitations as early as six moons in advance for the special day.</p><p>"How about we also have a traditional Valyrian wedding?" Levana asked, looking over at her betrothed who looked up from his book beside her.</p><p>"Eva," Aemond began, "we promised to the Queen that we would do most things her way."</p><p>"Still, Aemond," Levana sighed, "I want to be married by tradition and not just religion."</p><p>"Eva."</p><p>"Aemond, we're both Targaryens," Levana stated, "and I am also of Velaryon blood, the blood of Old Valyria runs deep within us."</p><p>"They will never agree," Aemond began, "not everyone in the Seven Kingdoms is familiar with our traditions."</p><p>"Then maybe it should just be the both of us," Levana suggested, "we can have Galatea and Ser Westerling as witnesses."</p><p>"Who will officiate the wedding, Eva?" Aemond asked.</p><p>The question left the female in thought, on one hand, her betrothed was correct - there was no one familiar with the custom except her Grandsire in King's Landing. The closest that they would have are Levana's immediate family and her paternal grandparents.</p><p>"We can fly to Dragonstone," Levana suggested, "we can do it in the guise of a visit and I can ask my mother to officiate for us."</p><p>"She will never agree."</p><p>"I know she will," Levana stated firmly.</p><p>"Levana, we cannot get married in secret," Aemond said as Levana smiled.</p><p>"It's not a secret if my mother knows," Levana said sheepishly as Aemond shook his head in defeat.</p><p>"Eva, my moon," Aemond began, "can it at least wait until our wedding and duty to the realm are done?"</p><p>The princess puffed her cheeks and nodded, "if this is the compromise that I must agree with, then I accept, my love."</p><p>The prince stood up from his seat and walked towards the princess, wrapping his arms around her shoulders as he looked at what the princess was reading, "ah, Visenya Targaryen, my wife's favorite role model."</p><p><em>"Your wife?" </em>Levana giggled, <em>"do not call me that yet, Aemond, I might get used to it."</em></p><p><em>"I would prefer that you do get used to it," </em>Aemond responded, placing a chaste kiss on the top of her head, <em>"you will be my wife soon, and I, your husband."</em></p><p><em>"Aemond," </em>the princess looked up at her betrothed, "hm?" Aemond responded as Levana placed a hand on top of his.</p><p><em>"I want children," </em>Levana stated, <em>"we have not discussed this matter yet but I want to make my intentions clear."</em></p><p><em>"Children, we shall have," </em>Aemond responded, <em>"and I swear to be the best father to them."</em></p><p>The princess looked at him with disbelief, <em>"you agree with me?"</em></p><p><em>"Why wouldn't I?" </em>Aemond said, <em>"to have children with you, Princess Levana Velaryon, would be an honor."</em></p><p><em>"I already have a name if we were to have a girl," </em>Levana smiled.</p><p>"Let me guess," Aemond placed one of his hands on the book that Levana was reading, "I wager that you want to name our daughter, Visenya."</p><p>Levana nodded, "Visenya and if we have a boy, I would like him to be named Baelon."</p><p>"Is there an attachment to the name?"</p><p>Levana nodded before hanging her head low, <em>"Baelon was the name of mother's younger brother,"</em> she stated, <em>"he died just a couple of hours after he was born."</em></p><p>"Eva..."</p><p><em>"The only living thing that we have to remember him by is Sunfyre,"</em> Levana smiled, <em>"that dragon was supposed to be his."</em></p><p>"I suppose your mother told you this story?" Aemond asked.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana began, "Baelon's egg was the only one that was laid before Aegon's birth and as such, the egg would go to him."</p><p>"A question of dragons and eggs," Aemond moved away from Levana to stand beside her, leaning against the table. The prince held the princess' hand and looked at her, "I do not think that Vhagar has the capability to still lay eggs, my love."</p><p>Levana thought for a while, "Aemond, the gods will provide."</p><p>"That or maybe his uncles can get him a pig to ride on," Aemond responded to which Levana responded by slapping his knee.</p><p>"That's our child, Aemond!"</p><p>"Your brothers thought of it a joke," Aemond teased, "as our child's father, I am allowed to jest," the prince chuckled as the doors of the library opened to reveal Queen Alicent with Galatea by his side.</p><p>"My Queen," Levana said as she stood up from her seat to bow to the woman who smiled at her.</p><p>"Aemond, may I borrow Princess Levana for a moment?" Queen Alicent asked, "dresses for the wedding have arrived and she needs to pick one that she will wear to the ceremony."</p><p>Aemond nodded and turned to Levana, lifting up her hand to place a kiss on her knuckles before the princess walked to the Queen's side.</p><p>"Your father wishes to see you," The Queen smiled at Aemond, "there is also a matter that he wishes to discuss with you with regard to the wedding."</p><p>The prince nodded as the females left. He would then head to his father's chambers to meet him about his concerns. Since the announcement of their wedding, both the King and Queen have allotted time to help the prince and princess with their planning - going as far as to arrange the menu and venue for them so the betrothed can focus on more personal aspects of the wedding.</p><p>The prince knocked on his father's door, "My King, it's Aemond."</p><p>"Enter," King Visersys said from inside the room as the prince opened the doors. Aemond walked inside his father's chambers, closing the door behind him before facing the King and bowing his head.</p><p>"You called for me, father?" Aemond asked as King Viserys nodded. The King gestured toward a cloak laid on one of the chairs in his room, "this will be Levana's bridal cloak."</p><p>Aemond approached the chair and lifted the cloak. The majority of the garment was red and black with golden accents that made it stand out. It was a beautiful cloak - very different to what Helaena wore during her own wedding.</p><p>"That belonged to Queen Aemma," King Viserys stated, "Levana's grandmother."</p><p>The prince turned to his father and bowed his head, "it's an honor that you would allow us to use this, My King."</p><p>King Viserys chuckled a response, "Levana is my favorite granddaughter," he stated, "I only wish the best for her and you."</p><p>"I will protect her, father," Aemond vowed.</p><p>"I expect nothing less," the King responded, "she will be the Queen, Aemond, and I trust that you will protect her."</p><p>"With all that I am and all that I ever will be."</p><p>"Aemond," King Viserys sighed, "do not take this lightly, my son, the line of my succession is still widely being debated despite my declarations for Rhaeynra and I am almost certain that a war will be fought over it."</p><p>"Father, you need not--"</p><p>"You will stick by Levana's side at all costs," King Viserys said, "even if it means abandoning the Red Keep and whoever takes my place as king, do you understand?"</p><p>Aemond straightened up and looked at the bridal cloak again before bowing his head.</p><p>

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>King Viserys vowed that his son and granddaughter would have the grandest wedding in the Seven Realms and he did well on his promise.</p><p>The celebration was to be seven days long with attendees expected to come from all over the Seven Kingdoms as well as envoys of the Free Cities and Dorne. Many believed that this wedding would rival that of the former King Jaehaerys I and Queen Alyssane with the lot calling it the "Second Golden Wedding".</p><p>Before the wedding ceremony, there would be six days of feasts, hunts, and tourneys - Lord Corlys himself volunteered to hold a mock sea battle, reminiscent of the original Golden Wedding. Meanwhile, Levana's younger brothers as well as Baela volunteered to do a dragon exhibition at the Dragonpit - they even got Aegon to join them as well, seeing as he was the one with the largest dragon among them — apart from the couple who they would be honoring.</p><p>Princess Rhaenyra and Levana's family arrived seven days before the start of the celebration to assist with the preparations. Rhaenyra along with Princess Rhaenys would join Queen Alicent and Levana in choosing dresses while Daemon <em>tried </em>his best to assist Aemond - much to the younger prince's distaste but he would have to live with it upon his betrothed's request.</p><p>"Ana, my love, I believe Princess Rhaenys has a gift for you," Rhaenyra stated as the aforementioned princess nodded. The four ladies were seated in the Queen's chambers where Levana was in the process of choosing her wedding dress and the other dresses that she would wear throughout the ceremony — a task that was far from over.</p><p>Galatea brought over a large box that she set on the table in front of the royals. She bowed her head before retreating to the door.</p><p>"This will be your maiden's cloak," Princess Rhaenys began, "this was my bridal cloak when I married your Grandsire and I think of no one else to use this but you," she continued before opening the box to reveal a cloak that was adorned with the Velaryon crest and in the colors of the house. Though, arguably, the most striking detail about the garment was the gold embellishments that scattered across it - made the garment stand out so much more.</p><p>"Thank you, grandma," Levana embraced Rhaenys tightly, "this means so much to me."</p><p>"Congratulations, Levana," Rhaenys whispered as her granddaughter broke the embrace to return to her seat beside the Queen. All the while, Levana had her eyes on the cloak, admiring it.</p><p>"There is also a question of who is to give you away, Ana," Rhaenyra said, "as your father is gone, <b>we</b> have yet to decide who will give you away."</p><p>Levana shrugged, "I would like my Grandsire, Lord Corlys, to give me away."</p><p>"Ana, you have a stepfath—"</p><p>"Mother," Levana sighed as Rhaenyra stopped, "with all the respect that is due, Daemon is not a Velaryon and I am not of his blood."</p><p>"Ana, I implore you to let him be a part of this."</p><p>"He is a part of it already," The younger princess began, "I'm allowing him to participate in whatever way he wants but I do not want him to give me away as he didn't raise me nor did he play a big part in my life."</p><p>"Princess Rhaenyra, I believe Levana has made her decision, she will be given away by Lord Corlys," Queen Alicent stated in finality as Levana nodded at the former before turning back to her mother.</p><p>"My grandsire raised me when Daemon did not," Levana added, "he was there for me even as a child and after my father's death where as I only met my stepfather during my tenth Name Day."</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at her daughter with disbelief before nodding in defeat, "I suppose Lord Corlys is the best person to stand in for your father."</p><p>"Lord Corlys is the only person who can represent my father," Levana stated, <b>"there is no one else."</b></p><p>The princess' mother leaned back against her chair in defeat, <em>"very well, it is your wedding."</em></p><p><em>"Mother, do not hold this against me," </em>Levana sighed as she reached out to hold her mother's hand, <em>"but I believe that the best person to stand in the absence of my father is his own."</em></p><p>Rhaenys listened in on their conversation and smiled slightly. Even with the years that she spent in the Red Keep, Levana has not forgotten her love for her paternal grandparents and their love for her.</p><p>"Princess," Queen Alicent called, "there is a matter of your wedding dress, you still have not chosen and we are drawing nearer to the date of the ceremony."</p><p>"God forbid that you're still choosing on the days of the hunt, the tourney, and the sea battle," Rhaenys chuckled, "Lord Corlys would want you to witness the might of the Velaryon fleet."</p><p>"Your Graces," Galatea called from the door, "the new batch of dresses from the seamstresses are here."</p><p>"My daughter," the Queen turned to Levana, "this is the fifth batch and we are running out of time as all your other dresses have been chosen."</p><p>Levana nodded, she would have to make a decision sooner or later.</p><p>"May Aemond come and choose with me?" Levana asked as all three elders looked at each other before Rhaenyra shook her head, "beloved, it's considered to be bad luck if my brother would see you in the dresses before the day of the ceremony."</p><p>"He need not see me wear them," Levana reasoned, "he can come in and choose from the spread."</p><p>"It amazes me how Levana wants Aemond to be very involved with everything," Rhaenys smiled, "they must have a strong bond."</p><p>"When we arrived, he came to me," Rhaenyra said, "he came to ask for my permission to marry Levana."</p><p>"He asked permission from Lord Corlys and I as well," Rhaenys chuckled, "I am relieved to know that the boy is genuine with his intentions towards Levana."</p><p>"It is decided," Queen Alicent sighed, "Aemond will assist the princess in choosing her bridal gown so that Levana might be able to finally make a decision."</p><p>Levana smiled at the Queen who did the same. Rhaenyra watched the exchange and couldn't help but feel as though she had been cheated of her relationship with Levana. Although there was also a part of her that knew she had a fault for not being able to have a relationship with her firstborn daughter.</p><p>Rhaenyra made that decision on her own and there was no one else to blame but herself.</p><p>"Galatea, please summon for Aemond," Levana turned to her handmaiden, "please tell him that I request his presence."</p><p>Galatea nodded and quickly left the Queen's chambers to inform Aemond of Levana's request. Meanwhile, the princess would continue to inspect the dresses laid out for her. For the princess, choosing a dress was a much more difficult task than learning how to properly maneuver her dragon across King's Landing.</p><p>"Levana, while we're here and in the discussion of the wedding," Queen Alicent took a seat on one of the couches, "have you and Aemond decided on the venue for the ceremony?"</p><p>"Yes, we have, Queen Mother and you'll be excited to hear that we've---"</p><p>"We've decided to hold it in the Dragonpit."</p><p>Levana turned towards the door where Aemond stood. The prince bowed to the females in front of him as his bride approached him, wrapping an arm around his own as she led him into the room.</p><p>"The Dragonpit?" Rhaenyra raised a brow, "a bold choice."</p><p>"We will have the ceremony at the Dragonpit then the wedding party shall proceed to the Red Keep," Levana explained, "and at the dawn of the day after, we'll have a Valyrian wedding ceremony."</p><p>"What Valyrian Ceremony?" Queen Alicent asked, "I was not informed of this."</p><p>"Levana and I were to discuss it with you, mother," Aemond stated," but we would like to be wed the way our ancestors were."</p><p>"I see no problem with that," Princess Rhaenys stated, "they are both from the blood of Old Valyria."</p><p>"There is no one that would preside over the ceremony," Queen Alicent stated, "as much as I would like to grant this request, no one will preside for you."</p><p>Levana and Aemond looked at each other with a smile before turning to Princess Rhaenys. The Queen Who Never Was looked at them with a raised brow before turning her attention to Levana who had a sheepish smile.</p><p>"I know what you're about to say," Rhaenys sighed, "perhaps not I but one of your grandsires might."</p><p>"I will ask them at once," Levana smiled as she motioned to leave with Aemond but they were stopped by the Queen.</p><p>"You can ask them later," Queen Alicent stated as she gestured towards the dresses, "you asked for Aemond to be brought here to help you choose a gown."</p><p>"Did you?" Aemond looked at Levana who nodded in response. The prince shook his head in amusement before turning around to inspect the dresses.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rhaenyra observed them, a smile on her face as she watched her daughter. Levana looked to be content with Aemond's company and as her mother, that was all she could ask for - for the young princess to have a husband that would love her with no repercussions.</p><p><em>'I only wish you could see this, Laenor,' </em>Rhaenyra thought as she continued to watch Levana and her betrothed with a smile on her face. </p>

<em>[Italics denote Valyrian speech]</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The festivities that led to the grand wedding ceremony were attended by all their guests - from the tourney to the dragon exhibition and to the mock sea battle - Levana and Aemond made sure that they would be there to not only participate in it but also be able to greet their guests personally. </p><p>The ladies in attendance took a liking to the princess for her beauty and wit while the lords admired Aemond’s perceptiveness and honor. Both of them nearly found no time to spend with each other as the festivities went about - though, they did enjoy flying together when they were asked by Jacaerys to participate in the dragon exhibition. </p><p>This was the day of the grand wedding ceremony and the whole of the Red Keep was busy preparing for it. Levana sat in her chambers with her brothers and stepsisters as they waited for the carriage that would deliver her and Aemond to Kingsroad where they would mount their dragons and make a grand entrance at the Dragonpit. </p><p>Rhaena and Baela were fussing over Levana’s hair as Jacaerys and Lucerys admired their older sister. From her seat, Levana looked into the mirror in front of her and admired the dress that Aemond chose for the ceremony. </p><p>As with tradition, the dress was white. It was a long-sleeved dress with a bodice designed in a way to resemble armor. The dress was topped with a gem-covered greatcloak that Levana imagined would look divine when she would take to the skies. The accents and embellishments were all gold - the shade had become a signature color of the princess. Completing the dress was a necklace that bore the Velaryon crest and on her head was a circlet adorned with a mixture of rubies, emeralds, and citrine. </p><p>Levana also wore jewelry that the Queen and her mother gave her for the occasion. Her mother gave her a pair of earrings while Queen Alicent gave the princess one of her rings. King Viserys would also extend the same courtesy to Aemond, bestowing upon him one of his own rings as well.</p><p>“Stop staring at me,” Levana chuckled as she looked at Lucerys, “it’s making me more nervous than I already am.” </p><p>“But you’re so beautiful, Ana,” Lucerys said, “you look just like mother and father!” </p><p>The compliment made Levana smile as she turned to Jacaerys who was looking at her from the other end of the room. </p><p>“Jace?” Levana called, “is there something wrong?" </p><p>“You’re getting married today,” Jacaerys responded, “things will be different from now on…” </p><p>The eldest of the bunch sighed and motioned for her younger brother to approach her. Jacaerys reluctantly stood up from his seat and stood beside Levana. The princess took his hand in hers and looked at him through the mirror of her vanity. </p><p>“It needn’t be, Jace,” Levana began, “I am still your sister and I will always be.” </p><p>“But you’re going to have a duty to Aemond now and you’ll have children soon,” Jacaerys reasoned, “things won’t be the same.” </p><p>Baela and Rhaena looked at each other as Levana turned to Jacaerys and placed a hand on his cheek, "but you are my brothers," she then turned to the two girls, "and my sisters, I have a duty to protect you all." </p><p>"You won't be able to protect us when you're here, we're in Dragonstone, and Baela is in Driftmark," Jacaerys reasoned. His older sister pinched his cheek and laughed, "Jacaerys Velaryon, do you have no trust in your sister?" </p><p>Jacaerys shook his head and embraced her tightly, "I'll just miss you more, Ana." </p><p>Lucerys also joined their embrace. Levana hugged her brothers tightly before looking at Rhaena and Baela through the mirror and motioning for them to join in the embrace. </p><p><b>"I am and will always be your sister," </b>Levana swore, <b>"I will protect all of you even if it costs me my life."</b></p><p>“We love you, Ana,” Jacaerys whispered as Levana nodded. </p><p>Their moment was interrupted by a knock on the door. </p><p>“Come in,” Levana stated as she broke from the embrace. The door opened to reveal Ser Westerling who looked at the princess with a smile, “it’s time, Your Grace.” </p><p>Levana nodded as she stood up from her chair. She checked the dress that Aemond picked out for her one last time before embracing her brothers and stepsisters individually. She would then join Ser Westerling as they walked towards the courtyard where her carriage would be waiting for her. </p><p>“I do believe congratulations are in order, Princess Levana,” Ser Westerling smiled, “it is an honor to be your escort on this day of days.” </p><p>Levana smiled and bowed her head in acknowledgment, “it’s an honor for me as well to have you as my escort, Ser Westerling,” she said, “thank you for your service as my sworn protector through the years that I have been a resident of the Red Keep.” </p><p>“And I shall continue to protect you, Your Grace,” Ser Westerling stated, “it is my duty and I will see it through to the end.” </p><p>Levana nodded as she arrived at the courtyard. She looked around in the hopes that she would be able to see Aemond before their wedding but it was to no avail as Ser Westerling informed her that the prince was already in his carriage. The princess sighed in defeat before boarding her own. </p><p>Ser Westerling closed the door to her carriage. The princess could hear the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard shout a plethora of commands before the carriages and their escorts began to move. </p><p>For their grand entrance, it would just be the princess and the prince making their way to Kingsroad. They flew their respective dragons there in advance so they wouldn’t have to worry about flying them at a time close to the ceremony. </p><p>Once the carriages arrived at Kingsroad, Levana excitedly got off her own to find Aemond already waiting for her outside. At Levana’s request, Aemond wore the colors of her house. He wore a deep sea green garment with silver accents and embellishments - very reminiscent of the Velaryon sigil. </p><p><em>"My beautiful bride,"</em> Aemond greeted as he took one of Levana's hands and brought it up to his lips to kiss her knuckles. </p><p><em>"My handsome groom,"</em> Levana smiled as she leaned closer to him to place a kiss on his cheek. Aemond smiled, wrapping an arm around her waist, <em>"I must say, I can't wait to finally taste those lips of yours." </em></p><p>"Oh, hush it you," Levana chuckled. As she was about to wrap her arms around him to embrace him, they were interrupted by a loud roar that the princess recognized to be that of her dragon's. </p><p>"Vermithor," Levana called as she held Aemond's hand and led him towards her dragon. The Bronze Fury let out a mighty roar before lowering its neck so the princess could touch him. Levana stroked her dragon's neck, smiling to herself before walking towards its face. Aemond watched his bride with much curiosity as the princess leaned her forehead against Vermithor's. </p><p><em>"Today is a big day,"</em> Levana whispered as her dragon bellowed, <em>"thank you for being a part of it."</em> </p><p>Aemond smiled at the sight. He has never seen someone with a stronger bond with their dragon than Levana. Though, like many, he also speculated that the reason why Vermithor took a strong liking to her was that she was of pure Valyrian blood and the direct descendant of King Jahaerys, the dragon's former rider.</p><p>Beside Vermithor was Vhagar, Aemond's own mount. The prince turned to his dragon and placed a hand on her neck, stroking it as she grumbled. </p><p><em>"Today is the day, Vhagar,"</em> Aemond stated, <em>"let's be off." </em></p><p>"My princess, my prince," Ser Westerling approached Levana, "it's time." </p><p>Levana turned to Aemond and nodded before slowly getting on Vermithor. The dragon lowered its neck and body as low as he could to help his rider. Aemond, on the other hand, was quick to mount Vhagar, taking her reigns in his hands before turning to Levana who had just settled. </p><p><em>"Shall we, my wife?"</em> Aemond asked. </p><p><em>"Let's be off, my husband."</em> </p><p>The two dragons braced themselves as they waited for a command. Levana and Aemond nodded to each other before saying in unison, <b><em>"fly."</em></b> </p><p>At the command, both Vhagar and Vermithor took to the skies and flew in the direction of the Dragonpit. </p><p>This was the beginning of the day of all days - <b>the second Golden Wedding.</b></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The guests of the Golden Wedding gathered at the Dragonpit - lords, and ladies were allowed inside the stronghold while the smallfolk could watch from outside. Levana also wanted the city's citizens to be a part of the wedding - something that the smallfolk greatly appreciated.</p><p>Queen Alicent was waiting impatiently for the bride and groom to arrive. While it was still early, she couldn't help but think that something had gone wrong and they were running late.</p><p>"Mother, please stop fussing," Helaena muttered, "they will come."</p><p>The Queen turned to her daughter and sighed. She would have to stop worrying and let the bride and groom do what they must for the wedding. At the request of Aemond and Levana, everyone in the royal family would wear a deep shade of lavender and gold - there would be no other color allowed except for that.</p><p>
<b>This was to show that they were united as a family.</b>
</p><p>Just when the Queen was about to throw in another comment, loud roars could be heard from a distance. Those in attendance turned their heads to the sky to see Vhagar and Vermithor quickly approaching the Dragonpit - Queen Alicent as well Princess Rhaenyra was relieved to see that their children were safe.</p><p>The crowd cheered as Levana and Aemond began to land their dragons. As they landed, they waved to those in attendance before unmounting their dragons. Levana was met by her grandmother and grandsire, Lord Corlys while Aemond was met by his parents.</p><p>"My little ocean," Lord Corlys smiled as he embraced Levana tightly, "how I wish your father could have been here to witness such a grand ceremony." The princess embraced her grandsire as well, "he is with us in spirit, grandsire."</p><p>The two broke their embrace as Princess Rhaenys spread out the maiden's cloak in her hands, "it's time, beloved."</p><p>Levana nodded, walking towards her grandmother who, with the help of Princess Rhaenyra, safely fastened the Velaryon cloak upon her shoulders. The princess would then embrace her mother tightly as her siblings and stepfather walked towards them.</p><p>"There are no words for the happiness in my heart, Levana," Princess Rhaenyra whispered as she kissed her daughter's forehead, "you've grown into such a lady and <b>I am proud of you.</b>"</p><p>Levana nodded as she broke away from the embrace to turn to her siblings. Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey raced to embrace their sister; at this point, all three were in tears but not as much as Jacaerys who was the closest to Levana.</p><p>Meanwhile, Aemond was met with congratulatory remarks from his immediate family. Helaena gave his brother her good wishes while Aegon opted to just give his brother a hug - they were never one for showing too much emotion toward each other.</p><p>The last to give his salutations to the prince was King Viserys.</p><p>"I entrust my granddaughter to you, Prince Aemond," King Viserys began, "she means the world to me, and I could only wish that you treat her with the same love that she has for you and more."</p><p>Aemond bowed to the king, "I vow to protect and cherish Princess Levana with all that I am and all that I will ever be."</p><p>King Viserys smiled at him before pulling Aemond into an embrace, "do not forget what I asked of you, my son."</p><p>Prince Aemond nodded before breaking the embrace and turning to his grandsire - the Lord Hand who handed him a golden halfhelm with wings on it - a symbol of House Targaryen. Queen Alicent gestured for the prince to follow her and as soon as Aemond placed the halfhelm on his head, he followed behind his mother.</p><p>Levana would follow closely behind her own and Lord Corlys who stood in place of her father.</p><p>Aemond and Levana would meet on top of a stage made for the event. The High Septon waited for the two of them as they walked in front of him.</p><p>Levana smiled as Aemond took her hands in his, lifting them to his lips to place a kiss on her knuckles, "my betrothed."</p><p>"My betrothed," Levana responded as Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenyra took their place just behind the princess while the King and Queen stood behind the prince.</p><p>The High Septon looked at the both of them before looking towards the crowd:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>The love of the Seven is holy and eternal. The source of life and love.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>We stand here today in thanks and praise to join two souls as one.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Joffrey would also walk up to the stage to stand beside the High Septon. He had in his hands the cushion that held the wedding rings of King Viserys and Queen Aemma - the rings that they would pass on to Aemond and Levana.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Father. Mother. Warrior. Smith. Maide. Crone. Stranger.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>Hear now their vows.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Joffrey walked to Aemond, presenting him with the cushion as the older prince took one of the rings and held Levana's hand in his. He looked into her eyes and smiled, <b>"I am yours and you are mine. Whatever may come and with this ring, I take you for my lady and my wife."</b></p><p>Aemond slipped the ring on Levana's finger as Joffrey walked to his sister. Levana took the ring in her hand and held Aemond's hand in hers, she took a deep breath before looking up at him and smiling, <b>"I am yours and you are mine. Whatever may come and with this ring, I take you for my lord and husband."</b></p><p>Levana slipped the ring on Aemond's finger as the prince smiled at her. The High Septon instructed Lord Corlys to come forward to take the Velaryon cloak from Levana's shoulders. The Lord of the Tides felt tears down his cheeks as Levana turned to embrace him as soon as the cloak was off of her shoulders.</p><p>Aegon walked towards Aemond, handing him the bridal cloak that their father had given to them. He handed over the cloak to his younger brother who nodded in acknowledgment before turning back to Levana.</p><p>The princess smiled at him as Aemond carefully wrapped the bridal cloak around Levana's shoulders, making sure that it was fastened properly before turning to the High Septon and nodding at him.</p><p>"You may now say your final vows," the High Septon stated as Aemond took Levana's hands in his, squeezing them as they took a step closer to each other before speaking the words, <b>"with this kiss, I pledge my love to you. Before the gods, I pledge my loyalty to you. Before men, I pledge to you my honor."</b></p><p>With that, Aemond leaned down to capture Levana's lips in a passionate kiss. Levana leaned towards him, deepening the kiss as Aemond wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her closer. The crowd around them began to cheer as the High Septon lifted his arms in a proclamation.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Here in the presence of gods and men, I proclaim Aemond of House Targaryen, Levana of House Velaryon to be man and wife.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>One flesh, one heart, one soul - now and forever.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Aemond and Levana pulled away from the kiss, the princess looked up at him and giggled as the prince looked into her eyes and whispered, "I love you, my wife."</p><p>Levana smiled in return, "I love you too, my husband."</p><p>"Long live Princess Levana! Long Live Prince Aemond!" The High Septon shouted as the crowd began to cheer the same phrase.</p><p>Aemond leaned his forehead against Levana's, his arms still wrapped around her waist, "all the wait for you was worth it, my love."</p><p>Levana smiled at him as the Kingsguard began to escort the guests back into their carriages for the wedding party at the Red Keep. Queen Alicent approached the couple with a smile on her face, "a carriage awaits the both of you."</p><p>Aemond nodded as he held Levana's hand tightly, "I shall accompany my wife to her chambers when we arrive at the Red Keep," he stated, "I do believe that she needs to change."</p><p>Queen Alicent raised a brow, "I have my doubts."</p><p>Aemond shook his head, "mother, please trust us," he chuckled, "I won't hold her for long."</p><p>With that, the prince carried his wife in his arms before rushing to the carriage to avoid the Queen. Once their carriage doors closed, Aemond pulled Levana to his lap, wrapping his arms around her tightly.</p><p>"I love you," Aemond whispered, "gods, I love you."</p><p>Levana smiled, shifting their positions slightly so she straddled him before placing her hands on his face, "and I love you with all my heart, my husband."</p><p>"My wife," Aemond whispered, capturing Levana's lips in another kiss, "I waited so long to do that."</p><p>"Now you don't have to wait," Levana responded, "nor hold back as I am yours now and you are mine."</p><p>The prince's gaze shifted slightly, there was a slight change in the atmosphere as Aemond held Levana's cheek, pulling her closer to him, "tonight, after the celebration, we will completely belong to each."</p><p>Levana nodded, stealing a kiss from Aemond before moving to sit down opposite his groom.</p><p>"Behave," Levana smiled, "we still have to face the crowd."</p><p>Aemond chuckled, "yes, my beloved, yes." </p>

<p>Levana's dress for the wedding party was a very special gown - why?</p><p>It was Queen Alicent's wedding dress. The exact same one that she wore during her wedding to King Viserys. Aemond wore a black and gold garment - very similar to what Levana's father wore during his own wedding to her mother according to Princess Rhaenys.</p><p>Levana kept her circlet but Aemond chose to forgo the halfhelm for the wedding party. It obscured his view and he didn't want that - especially when he wanted an undisturbed view of his wife who sat beside him at the banquet table.</p><p>For the wedding reception, the Queen chose to have their most prestigious attendees dine with them in the throne room while lesser nobles dined at the yards and small halls. Among those in attendance in the throne room included the lords of the Great Houses.</p><p>Levana watched as the nobilities conversed over dinner. She also listened in on her siblings' conversations, all of whom were seated on their side of the table while their parents sat on the opposite end.</p><p>"Ana, will you dance with me?" Jacaerys asked as the King turned to them with a small smile, "the bride's first dance is reserved for her groom, and her second, for her father."</p><p>"We can dance after the formalities, Jace," Levana smiled as her younger brother nodded excitedly before taking a seat again. Aemond looked at his wife before taking her hand in his, "would you like to dance with me, my love?"</p><p>Levana turned to the crowd and nodded, "might as well begin the festivities while it's still early," she giggled as Aemond stood up from his chair, escorting his bride to the center of the room as the musicians began to play the traditional tune for weddings.</p><p>The dance that the two of them were to perform was one that they had been practicing for years. It was only a few minutes long yet for the both of them, just to be in each other's company felt like a lifetime.</p><p>"We must have performed this dance numerous times for Septon Gygax and Septa Amaryllis," Aemond began, "yet I still feel as though I might make a drastic mistake."</p><p>Levana chuckled at her husband's remark as they stood with their backs to each other, arms raised before separating - a part of the dance that must've taken them months to perfect when they were much younger.</p><p>And at the end of the dance, Levana and Aemond bowed to each other as the crowd clapped. The nobilities would then walk to the dance floor as the band continued with another song.</p><p>The newly married couple made their way out of the floor to rejoin their family at the banquet table. From the corner of her eye, Levana spotted Galatea in one of the corners with a man who she was able to identify as the Lord Besian of House Greyjoy. As she returned to her seat, Levana couldn't help but notice the slight resemblance between the two of them — especially with their lavender eyes.</p><p>"Your Graces."</p><p>Levana snapped her head from Galatea to the man standing in front of their table. He had with him a knight of the Kingsguard — one that Levana recognized to be one of the newly inaugurated additions.</p><p>"Congratulations, Princess Levana and Prince Aemond," The man bowed his head, "House Nymeros Martell and Dorne wish to offer gifts of jewels and our finest fabrics," he said as the knight signaled for servants to come up to the table to show the exquisite fabrics and jewels in large boxes.</p><p>"Prince Sorin," Princess Rhaenyra spoke up, "thank you for gracing us with your presence."</p><p>"We would never miss a celebration," Prince Sorin smiled, "especially since the prince and princess are also in line to inherit the throne after King Viserys and you, Princess Rhaenyra."</p><p>"Thank you for your courtesy," Rhaenyra smiled as she gestured for Levana to speak.</p><p>"You have our gratitude for these wonderful gifts, Prince Sorin," Levana smiled, "my husband and I truly appreciate them."</p><p>"Your Graces," Prince Sorin turned to the knight beside him, "it is also an honor for me to introduce my close cousin, a new member of the Kingsguard, Ser Nandor of House Vaith."</p><p>Ser Nandor bowed before looking at Prince Sorin. The both of them bowed once more before making their exit.</p><p>Aemond looked at "tired, my love?"</p><p>The princess smiled slightly, "just a little bit, we haven't had enough rest since the festivities began."</p><p>"Would you like to rest now?" Aemond asked, "we can retreat to <em>our </em>chambers."</p><p>Of course, Prince Aemond was talking about Levana's chambers that would now be their shared one. The prince was very considerate and wanted his wife to be as comfortable as possible - which was the reason why he opted to transfer to Levana's chambers instead.</p><p>"Won't it be rude?" Levana asked, "the night is still young and the guests are still enjoying their time with us."</p><p>"Time with us?" Aemond chuckled, looking over at the guests enjoying the alcohol and food, "I assume our guests prefer the company of alcohol."</p><p>Levana looked at her younger brothers who all seemed tired as well, "we should retire so they can too."</p><p>Aemond nodded before sitting up straight, "my King, my Queen, my bride wishes to retire for the night."</p><p>Queen Alicent nodded, "Ser Harrold and Ser Criston shall escort the both of you."</p><p>The princess bride stood up and walked to the King and Queen, kissing their cheeks before walking towards Princess Rhaenys and Lord Corlys and doing the same. Princess Rhaenyra stood up from her chair to embrace Levana who did the same, "I'll see you in the morn, beloved," she stated as her daughter nodded.</p><p>Aemond and Levana walked in front of the banquet table and bowed before leaving the throne room. Ser Westerling and Ser Criston walked behind them as the two talked in hushed whispers.</p><p>"Tomorrow, we shall have our Valyrian wedding," Levana said, "have they shown you the frocks that we are to use?"</p><p>Aemond hummed, "they seem to be more comfortable than what we are wearing now."</p><p>"Has it been decided who will oversee the ceremony?" Aemond asked as Levana nodded, "King Viserys volunteered."</p><p>The prince was taken aback, "I never thought of him to be someone willing to do just that."</p><p>Levana turned to her husband and stopped walking, prompting the knights behind them to stop walking as well.</p><p>"Please do not think badly of King Viserys," Levana requested, he is your father and my Grandsire, he's trying his best, my love."</p><p>Aemond sighed, "when we were to marry, he treated me with more love than he did in the years that we spent betrothed to each other," he took Levana's hands in his, bringing it up to his lips and placing a kiss on her knuckles, "sometimes I think that, if it weren't for you, he wouldn't be able to call me his son."</p><p>Levana turned to Ser Westerling and Ser Criston, "you may leave us, we have it from here."</p><p>Ser Criston raised a brow, "Queen Alicent asked us--"</p><p>"You are to leave by the order of the princess," Levana stated, "I am allowed to ask you to leave."</p><p>"We cannot--"</p><p>"Ser Criston," Aemond began, "I believe the princess has asked for us to be left alone."</p><p>"Prince Aemond," Ser Criston began, "the Queen will not--"</p><p>
<b>"The princess will not ask you again, Cole."</b>
</p><p>Ser Westerling turned to Ser Cole and nodded, "excuse us, Prince Aemond, Princess Levana," he stated before bowing his head. Ser Cole followed suit, following after Ser Westerling. Aemond wrapped an arm around Levana's waist as they continued towards their chambers, there was a comfortable silence between them as Levana leaned her head on his shoulder.</p><p>"Levana," Aemond began, "I want you to know that if you do not want to do the bedding ceremony--"</p><p>"I want to do it, Aemond."</p><p>"Duty does not have to play a part in our marriage."</p><p>"Who says I want to bed with you because of our duty?" Levana asked, "Aemond, I want to give myself to you - the whole of me."</p><p>"As do I, Levana," Aemond responded, "I just do not want you to believe that we should do this now."</p><p>"Aemond, my love," Levana looked up at him, "we've waited half of our life to be together, why delay?"</p><p>The prince smiled and pulled Levana closer to capture her lips in a passionate kiss, breaking away only when they heard footsteps coming their way. Aemond and Levana laughed before running toward their chambers, locking the door behind them.</p><p>They looked at each other with a smile as Aemond wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her against his chest before placing a kiss on the top of her head.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"I love you, Levana Velaryon," Aemond whispered as his hand began to reach behind the princess' dress, tugging at her dress zipper. Levana chuckled as the prince was able to finally pull it down, the princess took a step back from her husband to gently take off the dress to reveal her inner clothes.</p><p>"I had hoped to ruin the dress," Aemond chuckled as Levana shook her head, "it was your mother's, Aemond, and I would like to keep it should we have a Visenya."</p><p>Levana turned around as Aemond approached her, the latter placing kisses down her neck as he did work on the princess' corset. The prince began to unravel the strings that held the garment together, all while making sure that his bride was comfortable.</p><p>"It's done," Aemond whispered as he took a step back, taking a seat on the bed as Levana turned to face him. The princess took a deep breath as she shrugged off her remaining clothes - revealing herself to her husband.</p><p>Aemond took in the sight of his wife. There were no words except perfection to describe what he thought of his wife - in an instant, he fell in love with her all over again. Aemond stretched out his hand for Levana to take, she hesitantly took his hand as the prince pulled her to his lap.</p><p>"You're beautiful," Aemond stated, pressing a chaste kiss to her lips, "you're so beautiful and you're mine."</p><p>Levana smiled as she looked at her husband, "yes, Aemond, I am yours."</p><p>Aemond captured Levana's lips in another passionate kiss as the princess began to undress him, hastily removing his belt and unbuttoning his top. The prince pulled away from their kiss to allow Levana to push off his clothes - helping her to undress him.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana whispered as the prince smiled at her, "you're beautiful."</p><p>"Not as much as you," Aemond responded as he held Levana's back to gently lay her down, straddling her as the princess looked up at him with pleading eyes.</p><p>"If you wish for me to stop at any time, tell me," Aemond requested, "I want this to be enjoyable for you as well, my love."</p><p>Levana nodded as the prince admired his wife's body, slowly, he began to run a hand up her torso, feeling her soft skin before taking her mounds in his hands. The princess let out a small moan as Aemond continued to knead her breasts, one of his hands reaching to pinch one of her nubs.</p><p>The prince was able to elicit a louder moan from the princess before leaning down to capture the other nub between his lips. He flicked the nub with his tongue while his other hand made its way down her torso and found itself in the delicate softness between her legs.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana choked out a moan as the prince gently used his thumb to rub at her clit.</p><p>"Hm?" Aemond looked up at her, removing his lips from her nub with a small pop. He continued to rub her warmth making Levana squirm under his touch.</p><p>"Do you quite like this, my love?" Aemond asked, stopping to move his hand further down her slit. Gently, he probed at her core with a finger, watching how she would react to his touch.</p><p>"M-More," Levana whispered, "please."</p><p>"You're so wet for me, Levana," Aemond muttered as he leaned up to kiss his wife before starting to kiss down her neck to her torso; stopping just above her core. The princess watched him intensely as the prince inserted two of his fingers into her warmth, prompting the princess to arch her back at the intrusion.</p><p>Aemond smiled to himself, enjoying Levana's reaction before experimentally licking her clit. The princess quivered at the sensation. The prince would then wrap his lips around the sensitive nub, sucking at it as he thrust his fingers into her wetness.</p><p>Such sensations were new to the princess which prompted her to moan loudly. The pleasure was just too much for her to take as she reached the peak of pleasure. Unconsciously, her legs wrapped around the prince who continued to suck on her clit as the princess rode out her climax.</p><p>Once she was done, Aemond sat on his knees, unzipping his pants before pushing them off. The prince made quick work of his undergarments - watching Levana whose eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>"Where is that supposed to go?" Levana asked as Aemond held his cock in his hands, stroking himself as he spread Levana's legs open once more.</p><p>"Here, my love," Aemond whispered as he thrust his fingers back inside her warmth, "I'm going to make love with you and make sure that you're full of my seed."</p><p>Levana shivered at his statement as he removed his fingers from her. He brought it up to his lips, licking at them. The princess watched him, her breath hitching as Aemond let out a satisfied moan, "delicious."</p><p>"My love," Aemond called, "you are to tell me if I am hurting you," he stated as Levana nodded.</p><p>"I will stop immediately," Aemond continued as his bride shook her head, "I don't want you to stop."</p><p>"And I do not want to hurt you," The prince retorted as he lined himself with her warmth, slowly inching himself inside her.</p><p>Aemond watched as the princess took deep breaths. Levana gripped the sheets as he slowly thrust himself inside her - groaning at the feeling of her tightness.</p><p>"Levana, are you alright?" Aemond asked as he stopped his thrusts, Levana looked up at him and nodded, "continue, Aemond."</p><p>The prince nodded as he continued to inch himself inside her until he was fully in. Aemond observed and looked at Levana, stilling his movements and allowing her to adjust to his size.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana called, "I feel so full."</p><p>There was a sense of pride that swelled in Aemond's chest, at the very least, he knew that he would be able to satisfy his bride. With that, the prince began to thrust slowly, allowing Levana to get used to the feeling.</p><p>"Tell me if I can move faster," Aemond whispered as he leaned down to kiss her cheek, "it will feel much better."</p><p>Levana nodded and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him into a kiss as she thrust her hips against his. Aemond smiled into the kiss as he began to pick up the pace with his thrusts, one of his hands finding her mounds once more to knead them.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana breathed as she reached up to touch his eyepatch, <b>"please let me see all of you." </b></p><p>Aemond hesitated but Levana leaned up slightly, <b>"please let me see you, my love,"</b> she requested, <b>"please let me see all of you," </b>she<b> </b>pleaded as Aemond nodded and helped her remove the eyepatch. Levana marveled at the sight, the wound has long healed and all that was left was a scar. In his eye socket was a sapphire - a beautiful sapphire - that complimented Aemond's purple eyes. </p><p>"Aemond," Levana smiled, "I love you, I love you so much," she whispered as he pulled him into a kiss.</p><p>Aemond broke away from the kiss, straightening his back so he could watch her face contort in pleasure as his thrusts became faster. Levana's moans were much louder now and it just further urged Aemond to pleasure her.</p><p>"Aemond, I'm--"</p><p>"Shh, I am as well," Aemond responded as he lifted Levana's legs up to his shoulders before leaning toward her. The princess gasped at the feeling of this new position - it made her feel fuller and she could feel him so much more.</p><p>Aemond continued to deeply thrust into her heat, groaning as he felt him tighten around her as she neared her climax.</p><p>"Levana," Aemond choked out, "I'm almost--"</p><p>Levana came with a loud groan and Aemond followed suit, filling her with his seed. The princess' body shook with her orgasm. She's not felt that much intensity before nor has she felt that much pleasure.</p><p>Slowly, Aemond lowered her legs so as to not cause her any strain. Levana groaned as Aemond shifted their positions slightly so he could embrace her from behind, keeping his cock buried inside her.</p><p>"Are you not going to...?" Levana trailed off as Aemond shook his head, "I have to make sure that my seed holds," he chuckled as he wrapped his arm around his waist. Pressing kisses against her shoulder.</p><p>"I love you, Levana."</p><p>"I love you too, Aemond." </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Dawn came upon King's Landing as Levana shifted awake. She groaned, her muscles aching from the night before. The princess rubbed her eyes before stretching, jolting awake when she realized Aemond was no longer beside her.</p><p>"Aemond?!" Levana called frantically, getting up from their shared bed and looking around her chambers.</p><p>"Aemond?!"</p><p>"Beloved?" Aemond called, emerging from the bath with nothing but a loosely wrapped towel around his waist. Levana sighed in relief as she walked to him, wrapping her arms around him as the prince chuckled.</p><p>"Miss me already?" Aemond asked as Levana shook her head, "you weren't beside me when I woke up."</p><p>"We have to start getting ready," The prince stated, "the ceremony will begin in a few hours."</p><p>"I thought I was dreaming," Levana chuckled, "I thought I had dreamt the entire wedding."</p><p>Aemond caressed her cheek and smiled, "none of this is a dream, Eva," he kissed her forehead as the princess looked up at him. Levana took in the sight of <em>her husband </em>- he was truly handsome, no one could deny that - the sapphire in his eye, in a way, had made him look more ethereal.</p><p>"You should get ready," Aemond kissed her forehead again, "I'll summon Galatea to be at your assistance once I change."</p><p>Levana looked at Aemond who was in the process of getting changed. She watched in silence before a knock came upon the door.</p><p>"Aemond, Levana."</p><p>"It's the Queen," Levana said as she walked towards the door, opening it slightly. The Queen smiled at her warmly before pushing the door open the rest of the way. Aemond had just finished pulling his pants up as Queen Alicent made her way inside. Rhaena and Baela followed suit as the Queen turned to Levana.</p><p>"Your sisters have volunteered to assist you in getting ready," Queen Alicent nodded at Levana before looking at Aemond.</p><p>"Lord Corlys wishes to speak to you before the ceremony, Aemond," The Queen stated as her eyes wandered to the bed. A look of relief and contentment on her face as she saw an unmistakable red stain on it.</p><p>Quickly, the Queen turned to the young royals, "the ceremony will precede breakfast so I suggest you all get ready now," she stated before leaving.</p><p>Aemond, on the other hand, finished dressing and walked towards his wife who was in the process of getting undressed for her bath. He pressed a chaste kiss on her cheek, "I'll go see to it that preparations are set," he whispered before walking out of the room.</p><p>Levana smiled before getting into the tub. Rhaena busied herself fixing the sheets while Baela made sure that the princess' wedding frock was ready.</p><p>"Did it hurt?" Rhaena asked as she finished fixing the bed. Levana looked up at her and shrugged, "it didn't," she responded.</p><p>"Did it really not?" Baela asked, "some of the handmaidens say that it's supposed to."</p><p>"It hurt at the beginning," Levana replied, "but it was nothing compared to what followed," she giggled as her <em>sisters </em>looked at each other and giggled with her.</p><p>"It's amazing the love that you both have for each other," Rhaena smiled, "congratulations, sister."</p><p>Levana looked at both of them from the tub with a smile, never in her life did she imagine that she would have sisters - two of them even. To think that they weren't at all close growing up but the three of them definitely have a special bond.</p><p>"You will look amazing in traditional wear, Ana," Baela complimented as Levana nodded in response, "I do want to look nice for Aemond," she responded.</p><p>"You will look perfect," Rhaena said in encouragement, "you are perfect in his eyes <b>and </b>ours no matter what."</p><p>"Thank you," Levana smiled at them, "my wedding became more special because of you both and I greatly appreciate all the support that you've given me."</p><p>"You need not thank us, Ana," Baela responded, <b>"we're sisters."</b></p><p>Levana smiled and nodded as she finished her bath. After that, Baela and Rhaena helped her dress into a traditional Valyrian frock that was gifted to them by Lord Bartimos of House Celtigar. It was a thoughtful gift as his assumption of a Valyrian wedding turned out to be true.</p><p>The frock was red and a shade of yellow that was easy on the eyes. Levana wore traditional headwear as well that her mother had given to her in the days prior to the ceremony. Rhaenyra admitted to Levana that it was her own when she married Daemon and while a part of the young princess would be bothered by this - she appreciated her mother's efforts in trying to be a part of her wedding.</p><p>Once preparations were done, Levana and her sisters made their way to the Great Hall. They were accompanied by Galatea and Ser Westerling who the princess invited to be a part of the ceremony as witnesses - they've both played a large role in her formative years and this was the least she could do to give back to them.</p><p>All eyes turned to Levana as she arrived at the Great Hall. The royal family as well as Levana's own gathered by the Iron Throne where Lord Corlys stood in a traditional frock as well. As it turns out, he would be presiding over the ceremony rather than King Viserys.</p><p>The King wanted Levana's paternal family to play a larger part in her wedding. It was the least he could do to honor Levana's late father.</p><p>Aemond looked at Levana with loving eyes as she made her way to him. The prince met her halfway and held her hand tightly. Rhaena and Baela smiled at each other before walking toward their parents.</p><p>Levana looked at her family and then at the Queen's. It seems that even after all the festivities, there was still a great divide between both sides - while it pained her to admit it, it would appear that the divide was now too great to fix. Still, Levana was glad that they were able to come together - even if it was just for the days of her wedding.</p><p>"I would've preferred to marry in our house's seat," Levana whispered as Aemond chuckled, "then maybe we shall marry there again when you inherit Dragonstone as queen," he responded as they arrived in front of the throne.</p><p>King Visersys was seated on the Iron Throne while Lord Corlys stood on the steps in front of it. He looked at the two young royals with a proud smile on his face as Helaena and Jacaerys stepped forward.</p><p>Helaena held a chalice of wine in her hand while Jacaerys had a blade of Dragonglass on top of a red cushion. The former placed the chalice on a stool in between Aemond and Levana before stepping aside once more.</p><p>Lord Corlys looked at the two of them and nodded. Jacaerys stepped in front of them, holding up the Dragonglass blade for Aemond to take. The prince hesitated for a while but with a smile from Levana, he took the blade in his hands.</p><p>Once the blade was in Aemond's hands, Lord Corlys began to speak:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>The Blood of Two joined as one Ghostly Flame and a Song of Shadows.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Aemond took a deep breath as he ran the blade down Levana's lower lip, cutting it slightly before lifting his hand to collect some of the blood and marking Levana's forehead. Once he was done, the princess would do the same action.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Two hearts as embers forged in the fourteen fires.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Aemond would then take the blade back in his left hand before cutting through the palm of his right. Levana would do the same, taking the blade in her right hand and cutting through her left. The two would then hold each other's hands - a symbol that they are now one. Their blood dropped from their hands to the wedding chalice below them.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Their future is forged in glass as the stars stand witness.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Levana returned the blade to her younger brother as Helaena walked towards them, collecting the chalice before handing it to Aemond. The prince took a deep breath as he drank from the chalice, looking at Levana's eyes as he handed the chalice to her to drink from. Levana accepted the chalice and drank from it before returning it to Helaena.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>Their vows are spoken through time, darkness, and light.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Lord Corlys looked at the both of them with a smile and gestured that the ceremony is finished. Aemond pulled Levana closer to him and captured her lips in a kiss, eliciting excited cheers from those in attendance - specifically, Levana's younger brothers and sisters.</p><p>"Shh, this is supposed to be a solemn affair."</p><p>Levana broke away from the kiss and chuckled slightly at her mother's scolding. She looked up at Aemond and smiled, <em>"we are now married before the gods and in the custom of our ancestors," </em>she whispered as her husband nodded.</p><p>King Viserys stood up from the throne and walked towards them, congratulating Lord Corlys before finally walking up to Levana and Aemond.</p><p>"Well done," King Viserys complimented, "I am proud that you have decided to honor our ancestors this way."</p><p>"It was all Levana, My King," Aemond said as Levana shook her head in amusement before stepping aside to allow her grandfather to address their family.</p><p>"Now that our children have been joined in marriage," King Viserys began, "I do hope that this will start a new leaf for all of us in this family."</p><p>"That is the hope," Levana muttered as Aemond placed a kiss on her temple.</p><p>"We shall now proceed to the banquet hall for breakfast," Queen Alicent stated, "we've prepared Levana's favorite desserts as well."</p><p>"We will join everyone in a while," Aemond stated, "Levana and I would like to change before eating."</p><p>"Do not take too long," Queen Alicent glared, "we shall eat this meal as a family."</p><p>Levana and Aemond nodded before retreating to their chambers. As the door closed, Levana removed the headpiece before doing the same with the frock. While it was indeed more comfortable than the dresses that she had to wear in the last couple of days, she still preferred her dresses.</p><p>Aemond was much faster than her in changing. The prince lent her a hand in fixing her dress and choosing which jewelry to wear. The princess decided to wear the necklace that Otto had given her during her tenth Name Day to breakfast - she's never worn it before so this would be a change.</p><p>"Ready?" Aemond asked as Levana nodded, getting up from her vanity as her husband held her hand.</p><p>The two made their way toward the banquet hall where their family was gathered. Aemond and Levana took their respective seats beside the King as Queen Alicent called for everyone to settle down. The Queen stood up and raised her cup before looking toward the couple.</p><p>"A toast to my children, Aemond and Levana," Queen Alicent smiled, "I am proud to have seen you both grow to be in love."</p><p>"Here, here!" Aegon raised his cup as the others followed suit. As the Queen took her seat, Lord Corlys also stood up and raised a glass, "a toast to my granddaughter, I am proud to be witness to the woman that you have grown into and know that you and your husband will always have a place in House Velaryon."</p><p>Levana raised a glass to her grandsire who took his seat. Aemond would then stand, taking his cup in his hands, "a toast to my wife, there is no other woman that I would see myself marrying than her, and I look forward to our life together."</p><p>The prince placed a kiss on the top of Levana's head as the princess stood up, she took a deep breath before raising her cup, "to House Velaryon and House Targaryen, may the Blood of the Dragon continue to run strong, and may our Houses remain by each other's side."</p><p>"Here, here!" King Viserys cheered as the others raised their glasses as well. Levana took a seat as they began to eat.</p><p>It was times like this that she wished to last. Times when her families were together and happy.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The year following their marriage was, in a word, pure bliss.</p><p>They enjoyed the news that Levana was expecting just a few moons after their marriage. The kingdom rejoiced with the coming of a new child in House Targaryen. While many saw this as the continuation of the Blood of the Dragon, many could not deny that this was a blessing to the Targaryen family.</p><p>This would, in a way, take away attention from talks of succession for a while.</p><p>Or, at least, that was the hope.</p><p>Levana, now in her 8th month, stood by her husband in the library. Aemond dedicated himself to further study while the princess would often have talks with the Queen and the Septas. It was times like this that they reveled in - the time that they had together.</p><p>"Take a break," Levana suggested, "your child and I wish to spend time with you."</p><p>Aemond looked up from his book and shifted his position so that he was facing Levana's pregnant belly. He placed both his hands on the bump and placed a kiss on it, "I cannot wait to see our child."</p><p>"And I am sure that our child cannot wait to see us," Levana chuckled.</p><p>Though, the smile on her face would be replaced with that of worry. Aemond did not fail to notice this as he took one of Levana's hands into his own, "what's bothering you, my love?"</p><p>Levana looked at him, "we do not if we are to have a son or a daughter," she confessed, "I do worry about what people are going to say."</p><p>"What do they have to say?" Aemond glared, "son or daughter, we will have a child and I will cut through anyone who tries to question that otherwise."</p><p>"If we had a daughter," Levana began, "that would further put the realm into disarray."</p><p>"The realm is already in disarray," Aemond responded, "son or daughter, Eva, they will be your heir."</p><p>"You're not going to be disappointed if I sired a daughter?" Levana asked, "if I were to name our daughter as heir?"</p><p>"Why would I question it?" Aemond asked, "our child is to be your heir and not mine as I am your consort," he continued as he stood up from his seat to wrap his arms around Levana, "regardless of gender, I will be there for them."</p><p>Levana smiled, looking up to place a chaste kiss on her husband's lips, "I'm glad that you think that way."</p><p>"We cannot hope for chicks when we have ducks," Aemond laughed, "it's about time that the realm learns to accept the inevitable."</p><p>The princess laughed at the comparison as the prince looked at his wife with an adoring smile.</p><p>"So, Visenya?" Aemond asked as Levana chuckled, "what would you like to name our child if she were to be a girl, Aemond?"</p><p>"Visenya is a beautiful name," Aemond stated, "but wouldn't you want to honor your great-grandmothers or your grandmothers even?"</p><p>"Aemma and Rhaenys?" Levana asked, "or maybe Alyssa and Jocelyn?"</p><p>"How about Alysanne or Daenerys?" Aemond asked, "so many names and yet we only have one moon left before you are due."</p><p>"We focus too much on the possibility that we are to have a daughter that we haven't decided on a son's name," Levana chuckled, "but I really want to name him Baelon after my uncle and my great-grandfather."</p><p>"Then we shall name our son Baelon," Aemond stated in finality, "and if he is the firstborn, he will rule the realm with honor, justice, peace, and valor."</p><p>"Of course, our daughter shall do the same," Levana smiled as the prince placed a kiss on her forehead.</p><p>"Ease your worries," Aemond smiled, "I will stand by and with you."</p><p>It gave Levana relief to know that her husband was not like others who would curse the gods if they were blessed with a firstborn daughter. At the very least, she would have that to comfort her as her husband wouldn't be the first to crucify her for it.</p><p>"Aemond, I have a request."</p><p>"Anything."</p><p>"I want my mother to be here when I give birth," Levana began, "if not my mother then at least I want my grandmother to be here."</p><p>"We'll talk to Queen Alicent about your request," Aemond promised.</p><p>Levana sighed, "at least if neither of them comes, I will have Helaena and Queen Mother to help me, and knowing such is a comfort."</p><p>Aemond sighed, he knew how hard Levana tried to keep her ties with her mother. After their wedding, the princess tried to be as available for her mother and siblings as much as possible but because Dragonstone was still an hour or so away from the Red Keep - even on dragonback - she couldn't always be there for them. He saw the strain it had on Levana and as much as it pained him, he asked her to take a step back from her efforts - especially when they found out that she was pregnant.</p><p>"We'll send the raven at once," Aemond promised, "though I do believe that Princess Rhaenys would be more amenable to it."</p><p>The princess nodded, "she would definitely be more amenable to spending weeks in the Red Keep with us whereas I don't think my mother would be able to last a day with the tension between her and the Queen."</p><p>"Even years after, I believe that it's my fault," Aemond mumbled, looking at Levana.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana sighed, "that's in the past and I do believe that most of us have moved on from it."</p><p>"That is the hope," Aemond chuckled as he brought up Levana's hand to his lips to place a kiss on her knuckles, "such beautiful hands," he complimented as the doors to the library opened to reveal Otto.</p><p>"King Viserys wishes to spend time with the princess," Otto stated as Levana nodded and pressed a kiss on Aemond's cheek. The prince would return to his books as the princess left the library. Otto approached his grandson with his arms crossed.</p><p>"I do hope, for your sake," Otto began, "you are hoping for a son."</p><p>"The throne is not mine to inherit," Aemond responded, "whatever my wife gives birth to will be enough for me."</p><p>"You are not right in the head, Aemond," Otto chuckled, "no one will accept Levana or her mother as the ruling monarch."</p><p>"Do you suggest I depose my own wife?" Aemond asked, "because I refuse to do such a thing."</p><p>"Your love is making you blind, boy," Otto responded, "we are playing a dangerous game here and if for a moment, you think that you are not involved in this then you are wrong."</p><p>Aemond stood up, slamming his fists against the table.</p><p>"Whatever vendetta you have against my wife and her mother," Aemond stated, "I will not be a part of it."</p><p>"Aemond," Otto glared, "that would mean betraying your own family."</p><p>Aemond chuckled, "in case you aren't aware of it, grandsire, I married into Levana's family as well and they are equally my family as you are."</p><p>"Be wary, boy," Otto hissed, "if you do not get your head right then I will see you a traitor and I will have your family pay for it."</p><p>Aemond turned to him and smiled, "my mother, the Queen, will know that you've threatened me and my wife."</p><p>"Queen Alicent is my ally," Otto revealed, "she would not turn her back on me."</p><p>"Not when Levana or her grandchild is involved," Aemond stated, "remember that you might be the Hand of the King but you are threatening the future Queen."</p><p>With that, Aemond walked out of the library; leaving Otto Hightower in awe. He had thought that Aemond would be one willing to play a pawn in his game but as it is, he might not be able to rely on his own grandson.</p><p>Otto would have to rethink his strategy. He didn't know who he had left in the Red Keep when most of them are so familiar with the princess. </p>

<p>It was in the middle of the night when Levana began her labor. The Red Keep was bustling with people in the halls and handmaidens began to pile into Levana and Aemond's chambers. The prince was pacing across the room in a slight panic as the maesters attended to his wife.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana called weakly, almost immediately, the prince went to her side, taking her hand in his.</p><p>"I'm afraid," The princess confessed as Aemond shook his head, "don't be, I'm with you."</p><p>Levana groaned in pain as the maester looked up at her, "the head has come, princess, you will need to push harder."</p><p>"I can't."</p><p>"Levana, my love," Aemond began, "please, you have to do this."</p><p>Levana let out a loud shout as Princess Rhaenys ran into the chambers. The princess had just arrived from Driftmark, she didn't even have the time to change her clothes as Levana was already in her labors.</p><p>"Ana," Rhaenys called, kneeling beside her opposite Aemond, "I'm here, my beloved."</p><p>"The head has come, Your Grace," the maester stated, "the princess needs to see this one through."</p><p>"My darling," Rhaenys began, "you know what you have to do, please, for the sake of your child."</p><p>Levana held her husband and grandmother's hands tightly as she began to push. She shouted loudly before hearing a loud cry erupt through the room.</p><p>"It's a son," the maester stated, standing up slightly to show the princess her newborn son, he would then hand him to the nurses to be cleaned before returning to tend to the princess.</p><p>"What's happening?" Princess Rhaenys asked, "is she not finished?"</p><p>"There's another babe, My Lady."</p><p>Levana turned to Aemond in shock as the pain came coursing through her body. The pain of birthing one child had been enough, but the princess was unsure if she would be able to survive the birth of another.</p><p>"I can't," Levana confessed, "I don't have the strength anymore, Aemond."</p><p>"Give the princess something for the pain!" Princess Rhaenys ordered as the other maesters scrambled to collect Milk of the Poppy before giving it to Levana who groaned at the pain. The pushing had made her exhausted but she still tried.</p><p>In the middle of her birthing, a loud yet distant roar could be heard from the Dragonpit. Queen Alicent walked into the room, immediately rushing to Aemond's side.</p><p>"The Dragonkeepers have come to inform us that Vermithor has been restless," Queen Alicent whispered, "how is Levana?"</p><p>"The princess has given birth to the first child, My Queen," the maester stated, "the second child is on the way."</p><p>"Second child?" Queen Alicent asked, "twins?"</p><p>"My Queen, the princess will have to see this through," the maester stated, "the birth of the first child took too long and I cannot guarantee the safety of the second if the princess does not push now."</p><p>Levana, upon hearing this, pushed with all her might. She was not about to lose a child.</p><p>"That's it, princess," the maester stated as Levana continued pushing. Even in pain, Levana couldn't bring herself to cry - she didn't have the strength for that anymore either.</p><p>A few minutes passed as another loud cry resounded through the room. Levana let out a groan of relief as the maester stood up from his stool, "a princess."</p><p>Rhaenys stood up from the floor to look at the baby in the maesters arms. One of the nurses would approach her as well to show her the first baby.</p><p>"The best of both worlds," Princess Rhaenys smiled as she gazed upon her great-grandchildren, "congratulations, Levana."</p><p>Queen Alicent joined the older princess in gazing upon the babes before the maester took away the prince to be cleaned. Aemond placed a kiss on Levana's forehead as the princess looked at him with a tired expression.</p><p>"You're beautiful," Aemond whispered as Levana weakly slapped his cheek.</p><p>"Have you both chosen their names?" Queen Alicent asked as Aemond nodded before turning to Levana.</p><p>"Baelon and Aemma," Levana responded. Princess Rhaenys' expression softened, she was touched that her granddaughter had chosen to honor her grandmother and uncle who had passed before them.</p><p>"Such beautiful names," Queen Alicent commented as Levana slowly sat up. The Queen urged her to stay in bed, "Levana, you mustn't, you have to recover your strength."</p><p>"We will keep a close eye on the princess should she need assistance," the maester stated as the handmaidens walked into the room and handed the two children to their parents. Levana held her son in her arms and Aemond held their daughter, it was such a serene image - one that Queen Alicent and Princess Rhaenys wished that they could keep.</p><p>"What of my mother?" Levana asked, "is she coming?"</p><p>Queen Alicent smiled at her slightly, "she will come in the morn."</p><p>"She will also be with your brothers," Princess Rhaenys stated, "Rhaena and Baela are to stay in Dragonstone and Driftmark for now but they will come soon."</p><p>"And Daemon?" Levana asked, "does my stepfather plan to grace us with his presence?"</p><p>Rhaenys shook her head, "but you need not worry about him, Ana, this is a cause for celebration."</p><p>The doors to Levana's chambers opened once more to reveal King Viserys and Sir Westerling. The princess was very touched to see her grandfather - she knew that he was getting weaker as the months passed and more than anything, she was glad that he could come and be one of the first to see his great-grandchildren.</p><p>"Congratulations, my girl," King Viserys smiled, kissing the top of Levana's head before looking at the babes.</p><p>"We've chosen the names Baelon and Aemma, grandsire," Levana revealed as King Visersys looked at her with a soft expression. She could see her grandfather shed a tear as she lifted up her son, "would you like to hold Baelon, grandsire?"</p><p>King Viserys smiled as Levana gently handed the babe to her grandsire. The king looked at the baby with such love that the princess couldn't help but cry at the sight as well.</p><p>"A feast should be in order," King Viserys stated, "we shall have a feast at dinner tomorrow for the birth of Prince Baelon and Princess Aemma."</p><p>"Grandsire, that's not necessary."</p><p>"No, allow me to do this for my great-grandchildren," King Viserys stated, "and your mother will be coming with your siblings so it will be a cause for celebration."</p><p>Levana shook her head in defeat as Aemond handed Aemma to Princess Rhaenys. The prince would then place a kiss on his wife's cheek, "you did well, Eva, thank you."</p><p>Levana looked up at Aemond with a soft smile, "thank you for being here, my love."</p><p>"I will never leave your side," Aemond promised, "but for now, you rest."</p><p>Levana took a deep breath and nodded, her eyes slowly closing for her to drift to sleep.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>
<em>The princess's eyes opened to reveal an empty field - there were no trees, no people. Then a loud roar erupted through the air and Vermithor came to land down in front of her. Levana looked at her dragon with worry - there was blood on him and there were wounds on him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Who did this to you?" Levana asked, walking towards her dragon and stroking his scales. The dragon bellowed as two others landed beside him. Levana could not mistake it - they were the same dragons in her vision many moons prior.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The dragons did not seem hostile toward her, in fact, they all looked to be docile - just like Vermithor. Levana walked towards a large dragon, not as large as the Bronze Fury but large compared to the other one. This dragon was black with menacing green eyes that looked at her softly.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The black dragon lowered its neck and the princess held up her hand to stroke his scales. The other dragon, a pale grey-white one also made its way to her. Levana would stroke his scales with her other hand while observing Vermithor.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her own dragon did not seem to be bothered that there were others by her side. Just as Levana was to make her way back to Vermithor, everything went black and the next she knew, she was in yet another field.</em>
</p><p>
<em>The dragons were gone and she was surrounded by fire.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Levana!"</em>
</p><p>
<em>The voice was familiar - it was Lucerys.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Luke!" Levana called out, looking around her to try and find her younger brother.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Luke!"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Ana!"</em>
</p><p>
<em>Lucerys appeared in front of her. The princess ran towards him but it seemed that he was just getting farther and farther no matter how fast she ran. The princess stopped to take a breath and when she looked up, Lucerys was no longer there.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Ana?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>Levana turned to see Jacaerys, covered in what seemed to be blood.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Jace?" Levana walked to him, and unlike Lucerys, he didn't disappear, "what happened to you, Jace?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Why did you betray us, Ana?" Jacaerys asked.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Betrayed?" Levana asked, "what do you mean betrayed?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>Jacaerys pointed at her and Levana looked down at herself. Her attired had been changed to what seemed to be red and gold armor. On her head was a crown of gold and rubies.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"You've betrayed the Black Queen, Ana," Jacaerys stated but as Levana was about to face her brother again, she came face-to-face with who she realized was a younger version of herself.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Who are you?" Levana asked as the child pointed at her, "I am you."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"This is not who I am."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Yes, it is," The child responded, "this is how it is always meant to be."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"What do you mean?" Levana asked, "I don't want to betray my own mother!"</em>
</p><p>
<em>The child looked at her with an earnest smile and before she knew it, she was inside the Grand Hall of the Red Keep. She was face-to-face with herself but her reflection wore a bloodied dress. Levana couldn't believe what she was seeing.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Slowly, the princess took a step forward closer to her reflection. The image of her did the same, before stopping so that they were faced with each other.</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Did we betray mother?"</em>
</p><p>
<em>The reflection shook her head.</em>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>"No, she betrayed us."</em>

<p>Levana couldn't get her dream out of her head for the rest of the day. Even in the midst of preparation for the banquet, she was out of it that even Princess Rhaenys noticed. Aemond was, of course, aware of the changes in his wife's temperament but kept to himself - he knew that Levana would come to him if she were ready to talk.</p><p>They were in their chambers, tending to the children when footsteps could be heard from outside the room.</p><p>"Ana!"</p><p>Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey excitedly came running into the room. Levana turned her attention to the door with a smile as Aemond rolled his eye.</p><p>"Nephews," Aemond greeted, "have you not been taught to knock first?"</p><p>"Aemond," Levana called, "let it go, they're just excited to see their niece and nephew."</p><p>Joffrey approached Levana who was seated on the couch with Aemma while Jacaerys approached Aemond and asked if he could carry Baelon. The older prince was to decline at first but when she saw the look that Levana had on her face, he conceded and gently handed his son over to his uncle.</p><p>"What are their names, Ana?" Lucerys asked as he joined Joffrey in admiring the babe in Levana's arms.</p><p>"This is Aemma," Levana smiled, holding her daughter up higher, "and her older brother is Baelon."</p><p>Jacaerys looked at his niece with an adoring smile as Levana turned to Lucerys and signaled for him to sit down. When the younger prince was seated, Levana instructed him on how to carry Aemma before handing the babe to him.</p><p>"She's so small," Lucerys smiled as Levana chuckled, "she's barely a day old, Luke, what do you expect?"</p><p>"Congratulations, Ana," Jacaerys turned to Levana before looking at Aemond, "uncle, they're beautiful and I have no doubt that they will grow to be as valiant as you two."</p><p>"That is the hope," Aemond chuckled a response as Princess Rhaenyra walked into the room with two dragonkeepers in tow. Levana stood to acknowledge her mother who looked at her with a warm smile. Rhaenyra walked to Levana and embraced her tightly while nodding at Aemond in acknowledgment.</p><p>"Congratulations, Ana," Rhaenyra smiled, "I trust that the birth was not too hard?"</p><p>Levana shook her head, "'twas tiring but we managed, mother."</p><p>"Congratulations, Aemond," Rhaenyra smiled as the prince gave her a slight nod. The older princess then signaled for the dragonkeepers to enter the room to place what Levana recognized to be an egg carrier on the table.</p><p>"Syrax was able to produce a clutch of eggs," Rhaenyra stated as the dragonkeepers opened the carrier to reveal two eggs - one a bronze color and the other a green, "our family would like to present these as gifts to Princess Aemma and Prince Baelon."</p><p>Levana turned to Aemond with a wide smile before embracing her mother again, "thank you, mother," she whispered, "this means so much to me."</p><p>"They should be placed in your children's cradles," Rhaenyra stated, "I'll have Galatea see to those arrangements at once," she said as Levana nodded.</p><p>"Mother," Levana began, "please stay with us for a while before the banquet," she requested, "I'm sure you would love to meet your grandchildren."</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at Levana with a smile before nodding, "I suppose that would be nice."</p><p>Levana gestured for her mother to join Lucerys on the couch as Jacaerys walked over to them. Baelon was ever so gently handed to Rhaenyra who took the babe in his arms. The older princess felt a tear fall from her eyes, alerting Levana who knelt on the couch beside her mother.</p><p>"Mother?" Levana called, "is something matter?"</p><p>Rhaenyra shook her head, "it's just that I never had the chance to hold my brother like this," she whispered, "I'm just happy that you chose to honor my brother this way."</p><p>Levana smiled and stood up to embrace her mother, "this is the best that I can honor them right now, mother."</p><p>"And this is enough," Rhaenyra responded as she turned to Lucerys who still had Aemma in his arms.</p><p>"I do believe that Aemma looks like Aemond," Rhaenya observed, "and Baelon is more on Levana's side."</p><p>"Such is a compliment," Aemond responded with a small smile before walking to Levana, "I'll see to the preparations, Eva," he whispered before kissing his wife's cheek and walking out of the door.</p><p>"I still believe that he finds our presence unbearable," Jacaerys crossed his arms, "I'm trying my best to like him for your sake, Ana, but he doesn't seem to like us."</p><p>"And you need not like him," Levana responded, "what matters to me is that you aren't fighting with him."</p><p>"But he's our family," Jacaerys defended, "he should at least be able to look at us without scorn."</p><p>"Jace," Levana sighed, "you are overthinking."</p><p>"Aemond will come around eventually," Rhaenyra stated, "and your sister is right as what matters the most is that there is no fighting between them and us."</p><p>"Why do you always assume that, mother?" Levana asked, "isn't it about time for us to forget our differences and act like an actual family?"</p><p>Rhaenyra took a deep breath, "Ana, there are things that we have to always be wary about and this is one of them."</p><p>"Mother-"</p><p>"Boys, leave us," Rhaenyra requested as the boys nodded. Lucerys slowly stood up from the couch and handed Aemma over to his older sister before leaving the room with his brothers. Levana looked at her mother and sighed, "I know what you are about to say."</p><p>"I see that you're trying to bring us together, Ana," Rhaenyra began, "and I appreciate it but this is beyond repair."</p><p>"Mother," Levana whined, "there is nothing that we can't repair if we just try."</p><p>"The Queen and I enjoyed a shared childhood and that's that."</p><p>"We need to unite our families, mother," Levana contested, "our family needs to stand against our common foes--"</p><p>The princess was cut off by the sharp look that her mother wore, "what common foe?" Rhaenyra asked.</p><p>"I was not implying anything, mother."</p><p>"I know you are," Rhaenyra stated as she stood up and placed his grandson in his cradle before turning to face Levana, "I know that you are still deeply hurt by the death of your father but to call Daemon a foe will not make it better."</p><p>"Why would you assume that it is Daemon that I am referring to?"</p><p>"Isn't that what everyone thinks?" Rhaenyra asked, "does everybody think me blind?"</p><p>"Mother," Levana stood up, "I am not holding Daemon at such a title nor did I ever think of him as a foe but there are others out there who would try to take what is rightfully ours."</p><p>"Like who?" Rhaenyra asked.</p><p>"The Lord Hand, for one," Levana began, "my husband has told me that he has threatened our succession - yours and mine."</p><p>"Aemond will not depose you."</p><p>"He might not," Levana sighed, "but Aegon will."</p><p>"Aegon adores you," Rhaenyra interjected, "even the Queen adores you and they will not go against you."</p><p>"Mother, I am your daughter," Levana stated, "once they go against you, they will also go against me and if you are not named heir then I will never succeed you."</p><p>Rhaenyra kept silent.</p><p>"Unless you've forgotten in the years that we've been apart that I am your heir," Levana smiled slightly, "you have never formally named an heir and while it is expected that I would succeed you in reign, you have sons."</p><p>"I need not name an heir when you will succeed me."</p><p>"And yet Grandsire still had to name you heir when you were the obvious choice."</p><p>"Do you suspect that I will remove you from my line?"</p><p>Levana shook her head, "was I even a part of it?"</p><p>Rhaenyra was taken aback, "Levana, you are my daughter and you are of my blood."</p><p>"Not with somebody that you loved."</p><p>"I loved your father."</p><p>"And yet my brothers have to suffer a reputation of being bastards and I had to be abandoned weeks after my father's death when my mother should be mourning with me."</p><p>"Has living in the Red Keep changed your view toward me?" Rhaenyra asked.</p><p>"No, mother," Levana responded, "it's just that I have matured and I have come to realize certain misfortunes that I had to endure because of decisions made by other people."</p><p>Rhaenyra took a deep breath.</p><p>"I apologize, wholeheartedly if I have made you feel abandoned," Rhaenyra began, "but what choice did I have?"</p><p>"Well, mother," Levana placed her daughter in her cradle before turning to Rhaenyra, "you could've taken me to Dragonstone when you married Daemon instead of abandoning me in Driftmark."</p><p>"I wanted to take you back."</p><p>"Or was I meant to be a reprieve and a political ruse so that House Velaryon will not lose loyalty to me and by extension," Levana smiled slightly, <b>"you?"</b></p><p>"Levana Velaryon," Rhaeynra glared, "how dare you accuse your own mother of this?"</p><p>"Because it was my own mother that would rather wallow away in Dragonstone while her own daughter was raised away from her," Levana retorted, "it was my own mother that was not there to hold my hand when my father died and it was my own mother that would only love me when it was convenient."</p><p><b>"How dare you?"</b> Rhaenyra asked, <b>"I love you, Levana, and if you think for one moment that my love for you isn't real then you've been manipulated by Queen Alicent and all her lies about me."</b></p><p>"Your love for my father wasn't real," Levana looked down, "how do you expect me to believe that you loved me?"</p><p>Rhaenyra walked towards her and held her face, "because you are mine," she began to cry, "there is no question between the bond of a mother and her child."</p><p>
<b>"Except for when Daemon Targaryen is involved."</b>
</p><p>"What is it with you and Daemon?!"</p><p>"Because Daemon has taken away everything from me in a span of a few moons when I was younger," Levana stated, "he took you and my brothers away and he was not even content with that he also tried to ruin my marriage!" she continued, "moons before Aemond and I even began planning our wedding, Daemon started a rumor that my husband was sired from the Queen's infidelity toward my Grandsire!"</p><p>"Daemon was with Laena at the time," Rhaenyra defended.</p><p>"Mother," Levana breathed, "this was before Daemon even looked at Aunt Laena."</p><p>"Where did you get this information?"</p><p>"The White Worm," Levana responded.</p><p>"How did you manage to get a hold of the White Worm?" Rhaenyra asked.</p><p>"I went to look for her to help Aemond and she found me."</p><p>"Amazing how you went to such extents for Aemond and not your own brothers."</p><p><b>"I was a child!" </b>Levana defended, "my brothers were called bastards when I was a child, mother!"</p><p>"You are their sister."</p><p>"And I tried my best to defend all of them," Levana stated, "even here in King's Landing and in the Red Keep when I came here, I tried to defend them but I was just a child."</p><p>"When you finally had the means to defend them, you chose to defend Aemond?"</p><p>"The same way that you're defending Daemon," Levana responded, "I know that you hate them but I hate your husband too and nothing will change that."</p><p>Before Rhaenyra could respond, a knock came on the door.</p><p>"Come in," Levana stated as the door opened to reveal Helaena who smiled at the both of them, "the banquet should begin soon, dear sister," she looked at her sister-in-law who nodded a response.</p><p>"We'll be there, Helaena," Levana responded.</p><p>"Father also requests that Baelon and Aemma be brought there," Helaena added as Levana did the same.</p><p>"I'll call for the nurses in a while, thank you."</p><p>With that, Helaena left the room and closed the door behind her. Just as Levana was to pick up her son from the cradle when Rhaenyra stopped her.</p><p>

<p>Levana couldn't look at her mother the entire banquet after their confrontation. While they both tried to maintain a civil front, the princess knew that her siblings and her husband could sense the tension between them.</p><p>Queen Alicent had Baelon in her arms while Helaena was doting on Aemma. Her brothers were in conversation with their uncles and for the longest time, they were all occupied - no one paid much attention to Levana who had returned to the habit of scratching her arms because of the anxiety that she was feeling after her conversation with Rhaenyra.</p><p>Both princesses, more than anything, knew that there was now an undeniable rift between the two of them.</p><p>"Eva," Aemond called, "you haven't touched your food at all, is it not to your liking?"</p><p>Levana turned to her husband with a small smile and shook her head, "I'm not too hungry."</p><p>"Yet the redness in your arms says otherwise," Aemond pointed at the spot that she had been scratching, "I thought you had outgrown that, love."</p><p>"I did but I can't help it," Levana whispered.</p><p>"Did something happen?" Aemond asked as his wife nodded.</p><p>"I had an argument with mother," Levana said in a hushed whisper, "it did not end well."</p><p>"And that is the reason for you to be scratching uncontrollably, again?" Aemond asked, taking his wife's hand in his.</p><p>"I have something to ask you after dinner," Levana responded, "it's important."</p><p>"Then we shall discuss it when we retreat to our chambers," Aemond pressed a kiss against Levana's knuckles and smiled at her while watching his nephews swarm around his children.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana looked up at him, "it's important that you consider deeply what I am about to ask of you."</p><p>"You are making me nervous," Aemond chuckled, "you are the only one capable of doing that."</p><p>"Do not jest, Aemond."</p><p>"I am trying to ease your worries," Aemond responded, "but if it would help, I've told mother about the threat on your claim to the throne and she will deal with the Hand."</p><p>"What she will say to Otto will not matter if my own mother removes me from her line," Levana said as Aemond raised a brow.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"After my confrontation with mother, it's likely that she won't name me as her heir."</p><p>"Does the King know about this?" Aemond asked, glancing at Rhaenyra who was watching her sons with a smile, "have you told anyone else?"</p><p>Levana shook her head, "you are not going to tell anyone else either unless she does something."</p><p>"Levana," Aemond hissed, "she will take advantage of the King's favor while he's still with us."</p><p>"And we will fall out of favor if we decide to point fingers, Aemond," Levana sighed, "let me handle my mother."</p><p>"Whatever you say, Eva," Aemond responded,<b> "I trust you."</b></p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>The day that succeeded the banquet was arguably the hardest for Levana. She knew that once her brothers and mother returned to Dragonstone, the rift between them would only grow larger - especially since Daemon was now an active participant in the ordeal.</p><p>Levana could ask for the support of the King and the Queen but she would rather deal with the matter on her own and in her own hands. She wouldn't give Daemon the satisfaction of standing a united front with the Queen or the Hightowers - as Levana suspected, that's what he has been wanting to achieve.</p><p>"Visit us sometime, Ana?" Joffrey asked as Levana smiled and ruffled his hair, "I'll try my best."</p><p>"When you come to Dragonstone, we can go hunting for the wild dragons," Jacaerys chuckled, causing the princess to roll her eyes, "we're going to get in trouble, Jace," Levana responded as her younger brother smiled and embraced her.</p><p>"I miss you so much," Jacaerys whispered as Levana embraced her brother tightly, "I miss you just the same, Jace."</p><p>"I'm sad that we couldn't stay any longer," Jacaerys sighed, "if it were up to me, I would stay at least a few moons just so I can spend more time with you."</p><p>Levana smiled at her brother, "take good care of them, Jace."</p><p>"You don't have to tell me twice, Ana," Jacaerys smiled, "I'll take charge."</p><p>"Be by mother's side and don't let her make judgments that you know won't benefit anyone," Levana requested, "I fear that as we grow farther apart, people will take advantage of it."</p><p>"You don't have to worry," Jacaerys assured, "I'll handle it, Ana."</p><p>"Thank you, Jace."</p><p>"You take care as well, please," Jacaerys looked at the ground, "I'm just so used to being able to see you that, until now, I haven't grown used to being away."</p><p>"Oh, Jace," Levana sighed, "I'll take care of myself, don't worry about me."</p><p>"If Aemond does anything to you, send me a raven and I will fly on dragonback," Jacaerys promised, "I will retrieve you even if it costs my life."</p><p>Levana's smile turned into a look of terror when she remembered her nightmare. The image of Jacarys covered in blood couldn't leave her mind.</p><p>"Please don't do anything stupid," Levana requested, "keep a close eye on Luke, Joff, and Rhaena."</p><p>Jacaerys nodded before embracing his sister again. The nurses would approach them with Baelon and Aemma in their arms as Jacaerys turned to bid farewell to them. The prince placed a kiss on their foreheads with a small smile.</p><p><b>"We'll be strangers when we meet again,"</b> Jacaerys sighed as he looked at his niece and nephew before nodding at his sister. The prince would join his mother on the ship as Lucerys and Joffrey approached Levana before embracing her.</p><p>"Keep an eye on Jace for me, will you?" Levana requested of her younger brothers who nodded in response.</p><p>"We'll keep Jace out of trouble," Lucerys promised as Joffrey nodded a response.</p><p>"But also, the both of you," Levana chuckled, "don't give our mother or your tutors too much of a hard time, yes?"</p><p>"Yes, Ana!" Lucerys promised before embracing her again. Joffrey followed as well before both princes' retreated to the both.</p><p>"Goodbye, mother," Levana called from the docks, "I will send invitations to the children's first Name Day."</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled, "even if you don't send them, we will be here for you."</p><p>With that, the boat to Dragonstone began to sail away from the docks. Levana stood there, waving farewell to her family as the nurses retreated to the carriages with Aemma and Baelon.</p><p>Things were going to be vastly different now. </p><p> </p>

<p>"Stop running, Aemma, you are going to ruin the hard work that Galatea did on your hair!"</p><p>Princess Aemma, now two years, stopped running for a short while to look at her mother who stood by the entrance to the Godswood. Her older brother, Baelon, was standing beside their mother.</p><p>"Tree!" Aemma pointed at the Weirwood Tree as Levana walked toward her, kneeling beside her as Baelon looked at his sister and held her hand.</p><p>"My beautiful girl," Levana smiled and turned to Baelon, "my handsome little boy," she pinched his nose before hugging them tightly.</p><p>"You two grow up so fast," Levana sighed, "please do not grow up too soon."</p><p>"They will not, I assure you."</p><p>Aemond walked towards them, an amused smile on his face as he knelt beside his wife and looked at their children. Aemma had grown to look more like this father while Baelon grew to look more like Levana - both shared lilac eyes as their parents. Aemma had the Targaryen pale blonde hair while Baelon had the Velaryon grey-white.</p><p>"What are you three doing up?" Aemond asked, "it's still dawn."</p><p>"I woke up and could no longer find sleep," Levana explained, "the children kept their nurses awake as well."</p><p>Aemond nodded before standing up, offering his hand to Levana to do the same.</p><p>"We received a raven in the early hour from Driftmark," Aemond stated, "it's from your great-uncle."</p><p>"Lord Vaemond?" Levana asked, "it's been years since I last saw him."</p><p>"It's about the inheritance to Driftmark."</p><p>"I thought that's already been settled," Levana stated, "Lucerys will inherit Driftmark."</p><p>"This also concerns you," Aemond looked down at their children, "and Jacaerys."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Your mother has never formally named an heir," Aemond stated, "and if we are going by order of birth, Jacaerys should be the one to inherit Driftmark if you are to be heir to the throne."</p><p>Levana was silent.</p><p>"Aemond, you can't be implying..."</p><p>"I am not implying," Aemond sighed, "I am stating the fact that it could be because your mother has plans to disinherit you."</p><p>"It's too early for this discussion."</p><p>
<b>"They are arriving today."</b>
</p><p>The princess looked at her husband in shock before taking Aemma in her arms. Aemond carried Baelon as Levana began to walk back into the castle. Already, numerous thoughts flooded her head - did her mother really mean for this to happen? Was she going to be removed from the line of succession?</p><p>"Who is coming from Driftmark?" Levana asked.</p><p>"Your grandmother and Baela," Aemond responded, "everyone in your family will come from Dragonstone."</p><p>The nurses met the prince and princess halfway before taking the children with them, allowing Levana and Aemond to retreat to the library - their sanctuary. The princess took a seat on the table in the farthest corner of the room; Aemond would stand beside her, leaning against the table as the princess was deep in thought.</p><p>"Surely my mother doesn't mean to disinherit me."</p><p>Aemond didn't want to put too much worry on his wife's shoulders but this was something often discussed by the Queen and the Hand - something that he knew Levana had knowledge of.</p><p>"If I am disinherited--"</p><p>"You will still be Queen if I am to be King."</p><p>Levana looked up at him, "I don't want to be a consort, Aemond, I am to be the Queen Mother."</p><p>"Eva."</p><p>"Don't start with me, Aemond," Levana sighed, "it's bad enough that my mother's ascent to the Iron Throne is being contested and now I have to worry about being disinherited."</p><p>"Do you want the Iron Throne?"</p><p>"It's my birthright."</p><p>"That's not my question, Eva," Aemond stated, "do you want the Iron Throne?"</p><p>Levana thought for a while, "it's my duty to the realm."</p><p>"But you do not want it."</p><p>"I want it, Aemond," Levana responded, "I want to serve my people and I want to be a Queen like my great-great-grandmother Alysanne."</p><p>"You are not Queen Alysanne," Aemond chuckled, "you are Levana Targaryen."</p><p>"Velaryon."</p><p>"Targaryen," Aemond chuckled, "you married me."</p><p>"I still stand as a member of House Velaryon," Levana reminded, "I do not plan to remove that part of my heritage. "</p><p>Aemond took a deep breath before taking a seat beside his wife, taking his hand in hers and looking into her eyes.</p><p>"King Viserys will not allow you to be disinherited," Aemond stated, "more than anything, he knows that you are the rightful heir."</p><p>"It doesn't matter if I am the rightful heir when my mother has as a son."</p><p>"A bastard."</p><p>Levana removed her hand from her husband's and looked at him in distaste, "how dare you call my brother a bastard?"</p><p>"Am I lying?"</p><p>The princess couldn't believe what she was hearing from her husband. With a heavy sigh, Levana looked away from him, "need I remind you that you were also accused of being a bastard?"</p><p>"There was no proof."</p><p>"You know how much I hate it when my brothers are called that," Levana stated, "you know how hard it is for me to hear that."</p><p>"Eva, this is inevitable"</p><p>"Inevitable?" Levana chortled, "not if I can help it."</p><p>"What are you going to do?" Aemond asked, raising a brow.</p><p>"I'm going to stand with my family," Levana stated.</p><p>"We are not to be biased, Eva," Aemond reminded, "we are the royal family."</p><p>"And yet you dare to call my brothers bastards?"</p><p>Levana stood up from her seat and walked past her husband, "remember that they are my blood, Aemond," she stated, "and they will always be a part of me."</p><p>Aemond sighed deeply, "the Queen will not be pleased."</p><p>"I know," Levana responded, "but I know that the King will stand with me as well."</p><p>Aemond stood up and walked after his wife, wrapping his arms around her waist and pressing a kiss on her head, "don't do this."</p><p><b>"I have to do this, Aemond,"</b> Levana sighed, <b>"if no one is going to help protect my family then I will have to do it." </b></p>

<p>The Red Keep was, in a way, busy with preparations to welcome their guests from beyond Blackwater Bay. Levana was in her children's chambers, watching as they were being dressed by their nurses. Galatea stood by her side, braiding her mistress' hair as the princess watched the children.</p><p>"You've been quiet, My Lady," Galatea stated, "forgive me, but this is unlike you."</p><p>Levana sighed, "I worry about what is to happen, Galatea."</p><p>"I'm sure it won't be anything too bad, Your Grace," Galatea responded as she finished Levana's hair by placing a gold headband on her head - a gift from Aemond on the first year of their marriage.</p><p>
<b>"It will be bad for the babe if her mother is to worry too much."</b>
</p><p>Levana chuckled slightly before placing a hand on her stomach, she was only about three months along and yet there was a visible bump already. Though, her small smile would turn sour at the reminder of her last encounter with Princess Rhaenyra.</p><p>"My mother and I fought the last time that I saw her," Levana muttered, "Baelon and Aemma were just born then and it's been two years since."</p><p>"Your mother loves you, Your Grace," Galatea smiled in an attempt to soothe the princess' worries, "I am confident that you will be able to reconcile."</p><p>Levana looked up at her handmaiden and smiled, "I'm glad you think that way, Galatea."</p><p>"I prefer to see the brighter side of things, My Lady," Galatea nodded, "that is why I do not doubt that this issue with Driftmark will be solved in the best way possible."</p><p>The princess nodded as the door to the nursery opened to reveal Ser Nandor. He bowed to them and turned to the princess, "Princess Rhaenyra and her entourage will arrive shortly, Your Grace."</p><p>Levana excitedly stood up from her chair and called for her children. Aemma and Baelon stood up from the carpet and waddled toward their mother who held their hands and made their way out of the room. Ser Nandor followed behind them, keeping a close eye on the two children in case one of them were to stumble or fall.</p><p>"The prince and princess are running quite well, Your Grace," Ser Nandor commented as he tried to keep up with a very excited Levana who turned her head to smile at him, "well, you should see them in the morn," she chuckled.</p><p>Ser Nandor had grown quite close to Levana and Galatea in the years that he's served the Kingsguard. He turned out to be one of Levana's closest allies - one that he could trust apart from Ser Westerling.</p><p>Levana and her children made their way to the outer courtyard. Levana walked out of the door and stood on the steps of the stairs, anticipating the arrival of her family.</p><p>"Mama, who?" Aemma asked, looking up at her mother who smiled at her, "we're meeting your grandmother and uncles."</p><p>"Grandmother?" Aemma tilted her head as Baelon tugged on his mother's sleeve, "Queen!"</p><p>"No, Baelon," Levana chuckled, "this is my mother, Princess Rhaenyra."</p><p>"I'm princess too!" Aemma giggled as Levana nodded, "yes, you are also a princess just like us."</p><p>The Barbican opened to reveal two carriages, Levana waved at them excitedly as a carriage stopped in front of her. A knight stepped in front of Levana and bowed at her before placing a hand on the carriage door, "All hail Rhaenyra of House Targaryen, Princess of Dragonstone and Heir to the Iron Throne and her Royal Consort, Prince Daemon Targaryen."</p><p>The door of the carriage opened to reveal Princess Rhaenyra. Immediately, the princess smiled at her daughter who bowed at her. Rhaenyra walked up the steps of the stairs and looked at her grandchildren.</p><p>"Like what Galatea taught you," Levana gestured for her children to step forward and walk toward her mother.</p><p>"I'm Princess Aemma!"</p><p>"I'm Prince Baelon!"</p><p>The two children bowed in unison in front of their grandmother who chuckled a response, "it seems like it was only yesterday when you both first came into the world," Rhaenyra looked at Levana and then focused her attention on her daughter's belly.</p><p>"You as well?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana nodded, "a few months, mother."</p><p>Just as Rhaenyra was about to congratulate her daughter, Daemon stepped to her side. Almost immediately, the tension grew and the children took a step back to hide behind their mother. Clearing her throat, Levana turned to Daemon with a smile.</p><p>"Stepfather," Levana bowed her head, "how nice of you to grace us with your presence."</p><p>Daemon chuckled, "thank you for the warm welcome, Princess Levana," he responded before looking at the two children, "this must be Aemma and Baelon."</p><p>"Yes, <em>your </em>grandchildren," Levana said as the two children bowed their heads to acknowledge him. The Targaryen prince chuckled in amusement, "they seem to take after the both of you quite well, that's a relief."</p><p>Levana twitched slightly at his remark, "King Viserys is expecting you," she stated before taking her children's hands in hers and walking ahead of them.</p><p>"Levana," Rhaeynra called as the princess stopped in her tracks.</p><p>"You may walk ahead," Rhaenyra stated, "Daemon and I will find the King ourselves."</p><p>"Very well," Levana responded, bowing her head to her mother before escorting her children back to the nursery. Once her children had settled, Levana took a seat on one of the couches, taking deep breaths.</p><p>Seeing Daemon after all these years did not remove her disdain for him - the mere sight of him was enough to make her stomach drop.</p><p>"You look like you've seen a ghost."</p><p>Levana turned to the door to see her husband leaning against it with his arms crossed. She sighed and gestured for him to join her on the couch. The prince walked to his wife, pressing a kiss on her cheek before sitting beside her.</p><p>
<b>"They're here."</b>
</p><p>Aemond hummed as he held her hand in his, "have you seen them?"</p><p>"I was at the gate to greet them," Levana stated, "at first, greeting my mother was a pleasure but then Daemon showed his face."</p><p>Aemond chuckled, "sometimes I believe that his presence is unnecessary."</p><p>"I know two people who will beg to disagree with you," Levana chuckled as Aemond placed his other hand on top of the princess' stomach, stroking it slightly with a smile on his face.</p><p>"Visenya or Baelor?"</p><p>Levana shook her head, "let's choose a name when the babe arrives," she stated, "it would be just a tad bit more exciting."</p><p>"Nerve-wracking, you mean," Aemond chuckled, "but to choose a name spontaneously?"</p><p>"Aemond," Levana chuckled, "that way, we'll be able to choose a name that best fits the babe."</p><p>Aemond knew that he wouldn't be able to question his wife with that logic - after all, he tried not to question her with such matters. She was the mother and she was carrying the babe, Aemond would like to think that she knew what she was doing.</p><p>"We would have to join during the discussion," Levana sighed, "people will expect me to be at my mother's side."</p><p>"No one expects you of anything," Aemond responded, "you are my wife and you will stay by mine."</p><p>"My love."</p><p>"You cannot remain neutral forever, Eva," Aemond stated, "you know that and while I do know that it is painful, you will have to choose one day."</p><p>Levana sighed before looking at their children, "I can't help it."</p><p>"Eva," Aemond placed a hand on her cheek, "you have a family now and more than anything, your mother should understand that it's not your duty to defend her anymore."</p><p>"Aemond."</p><p>"Tell me that I'm wrong and I'll concede."</p><p>Levana kept silent, <b>her husband was right</b>. The princess just resigned to watch their children while Aemond sighed and stood up to walk towards the two children playing on the floor and joining them.</p><p>This was a welcome sight for Levana. She adored her husband for being an amazing father to their children. Even though Aemond did not have a proper father figure growing up, Levana was thankful that he stepped into the role so naturally.</p><p>A knock came upon the door and the Queen walked into the room with a frown on her face.</p><p>"Eva," The Queen began, "you are requested to also be at the trial tomorrow."</p><p>Levana feared that.</p><p>"You don't have to speak up," Queen Alicent stated, "but our family is asked to be there."</p><p>"What if I am asked to speak?" Levana asked, "what then?"</p><p>"Then we trust that you will be able to stand for what is true," Queen Alicent walked to her and placed a hand on her shoulder, "to speak for what is right."</p><p>"I will be disowned."</p><p>"Then if your mother disowns you, I will take you as my daughter," the Queen stated, "if she deposes you then I will make a decree that cements your position as heir to the throne which I am sure that your grandsire, the King, will agree with."</p><p>Levana was speechless. She didn't know that the Queen would go to that extent.</p><p>"Aemond, please take the children and leave us."</p><p>Aemond looked at Levana who nodded in response. The prince took Aemma into his arms and held Baelon's hand before leaving the room, bowing to the two females before allowing the guards to close the door behind him.</p><p>"What are you afraid of, Levana?" Queen Alicent asked, "is it your mother?"</p><p>Levana took a deep breath, "I've wanted my mother's approval for so long, Queen Alicent, I just don't want to take whatever progress I have away when I don't have an idea how far I still have to go."</p><p>"Oh, my sweet child," Queen Alicent took a seat beside Levana and held her hand, "you do not need approval from anyone even from myself."</p><p>"Queen Alicent..."</p><p>"If your mother does not approve of you, so what?" Queen Alicent asked, "my love if she does not approve of you then I know a handful of others who will - including myself and the King."</p><p>Levana couldn't help but cry at the Queen's remarks.</p><p>"You are enough, Levana," Queen Alicent stated, "so enough and more."</p><p>The Queen pulled Levana in for an embrace. The princess sobbed into the Queen's shoulder as the latter comforted her.</p><p>After years of fighting for her mother's approval, the Queen's statements allowed her to realize that maybe - she didn't need it after all, especially when her mother was so willing to let her go in the first place. </p>

<p>After her discussion with Aemond, Levana found herself back in the library. Ser Nandor stood as her guard while Ser Westerling was the aid of the King. The princess was flipping through her books when Galatea approached them. The handmaiden nodded at the knight who acknowledged her with a small smile.</p><p>“Princess,” Galatea called, “Prince Aemond is training in the courtyard and he requests for your presence.” </p><p>“The children?” Levana asked before looking up from her book, “they’re with the nurses, Your Grace,” she stated as the princess took a deep breath before getting up from her chair and signaling for Ser Nandor to follow her as she began to walk to the courtyard. </p><p>“My lady,” Ser Nandor began, “if you do not mind me asking, how many siblings do you have?” </p><p>Levana chuckled slightly, “it depends on what you are asking of me.” </p><p>“Your Grace?” Ser Nandor raised a brow, “I do not follow.” </p><p>“I have three trueborn brothers, two stepsisters, two half-brothers, and another half-sibling on the way,” Levana explained, “does that answer your question?” </p><p>Ser Nandor gave her an amazed look before nodding, “forgive my intrusion.” </p><p>“Not at all, Ser Nandor, I appreciate your attempt to get to know me better,” Levana smiled as they arrived at the courtyard. From the top of the stairs, Levana saw her husband training with Ser Cole. Her eyes wandered to the small crowd gathered to observe two faces that were all too familiar to her.</p><p>Quickly, Levana made her way down the steps to approach the crowd of nobles with a small smile on her face. </p><p>“Princess Levana,” one of the ladies bowed her head as the princess did the same. </p><p>“Congratulations on your pregnancy, princess,” another lady greeted as Levana smiled, “thank you, a third child is a blessing to the prince and I.” </p><p>“What brings you to the courtyard?” One of the lords asked, “usually you watch the prince from the balcony.” </p><p>“I was at the balcony,” Levana smiled, “but I couldn’t help but notice that you were staring at my brothers, the Princes Jacaerys and Lucerys, might I ask why?” </p><p>None of the nobles in front of her could speak. </p><p>“You think them bastards, am I correct?” Levana asked, “you think them unworthy of the Driftmark Throne and the Iron Throne at that, yes?” </p><p>The nobles all looked appalled as Levana made her claims, “I may not look like it but the gods have blessed me with an incredible sense of hearing and unfortunately, what you have been whispering amongst yourselves are grounds for treason.” </p><p>The lords and ladies looked at each other before bowing to Levana in apology and dispursing. Levana, on the other hand, walked toward her brothers who were looking at swords. </p><p>“I remember a boy who tried to swing Sir Cole’s morningstar and almost took his own head off,” Levana chuckled, “I wonder who that boy is.” </p><p>The two Velaryon princes turned to her and excitedly ran up to embrace her. The princess did the same, wrapping her arms around each brother. </p><p>“Ana,” Lucerys smiled, “have you been well?” </p><p>Levana nodded, ruffling her younger brother’s hair before turning to Jacaerys, “gods, Jace, you look like a different person now,” she smiled before placing a hand on the small bump on her stomach. </p><p>Jacaerys chuckled a response before looking at her sister’s stomach, immediately, his eyes widened, “Ana, are you…?” </p><p>The princess nodded, “Aemma and Baelon are going to have a younger sibling soon.” </p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys looked at each other before hugging their sister again. Their small reunion would soon be disturbed by the loud crash of a sword against a shield. Levana turned towards the small crowd assembling in the corner of the courtyard where her husband was still in battle with Ser Cole. The princess took her brothers’ hand in hers and led them towards the crowd so they could all watch Aemond who clearly had the upper hand. </p><p>Levana watched along with his brothers as Aemond continued to fight. At one point, part of his shield was broken off by Sir Cole. While the princess knew that her husband was a perfectly capable fighter, she couldn’t help but still worry about them during training. </p><p>“Aemond!” Levana called just as the prince dealt the finishing blow, holding a sword against Cole’s neck. </p><p>“Well done, my prince,” Ser Cole smiled, “you’ll be winning tourneys in no time.” </p><p>“I don’t give a shit about tourneys, Cole,” Aemond stated before turning his attention to Jacaerys and Lucerys, “nephews, have you come to train?” </p><p>Jacaerys stared at him scornfully as Levana walked up to him and handed him a handkerchief. The prince took the cloth with a small before pressing a kiss against Levana’s cheek and taking the cloth to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</p><p>“Be a bit kinder to my brothers,” Levana requested, “everything is already nervewracking as it is.” </p><p>Aemond was about to respond when the Barbican opened to reveal knights from Levana's house with Ser Vaemond at their side. Aemond smiled slightly as Levana rolled her eyes in response. </p><p>Ser Vaemond stopped in front of Aemond and Levana, "my grandniece," he began, "I would like to congratulate you and the prince on the account of your pregnancy." </p><p>Levana nodded with a small smile, "thank you, Ser Vaemond," she responded before gesturing toward the door, "I believe that the Queen and the Hand are expecting you." </p><p>"Indeed they are,"Ser Vaemond stated before bowing to them again and making his way into the castle. Levana looked at his younger brothers before shaking her head and gesturing for them to head inside as well. </p><p>“I somehow remember House Velaryon’s colors to be brighter,” Aemond whispered as Levana sighed, “amusingly, I remember the same thing.” </p><p>The prince looked at his wife and held her hand tightly, “all will be well, I swear it,” he promised as they walked back into the castle.</p><p>In her mind, everything was far from well, and more than anything, Levana just wished that the trial would be over.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━<br/><br/></p><p>The day of the trial came after the day of arrival. Levana received news that her grandmother and Baela had come later that day when she was in the company of the maesters - the princess bled and as such, was told to rest for the rest of the day. </p><p>It was the day of the trial and Levana sat in front of her vanity as Galatea finished with her hair, placing the golden headband on her head before informing her mistress that she was done with her hair. Levana gave her handmaiden a nod before standing and looking at herself in the mirror, somehow, the color green was not so pleasing to look at. Galatea bowed to her before leaving the room, allowing the princess to be alone with her thoughts.</p><p>Green was the color that Queen Alicent instructed her to wear and it gave Levana an uneasy feeling. She paced back and forth before Aemond walked into the room, a concerned expression on his face as he wrapped his arms around Levana’s waist. Like Levana, Aemond also wore a shade of dark green - it looked regal on the both of them but it still left the princess uneasy. </p><p>“I’ll tell the Queen that you are unwell,” Aemond whispered, “she’ll understand.” </p><p>“I have to be there, Aemond.” </p><p>“Then you need to stop worrying too much,” Aemond stated, “otherwise, the Queen will not appreciate your presence.” </p><p>“Will she sit the throne today?” Levana asked as her husband shook his head, “the Hand will be sitting on the throne during the trial today.” </p><p>The princess took a deep breath as a knock came upon the door. It opened slightly to reveal Aegon also wore the same colors. He walked into the room and crossed his arms, “it’s time.” </p><p>The older prince nodded at his brother before leaving the room. Levana turned to face Aemond who pulled her in for a kiss. The princess smiled slightly, it comforted her to receive such affection from her husband at such a time. </p><p>“Can you go ahead?” Levana asked, “I need Galatea to adjust my corset.” </p><p>Aemond nodded and kissed her again before leaving the room. Galatea would arrive shortly after with a confused expression, “Your Grace, the prince told me that your corset needed adjustments?” </p><p>Levana nodded. </p><p>“My lady, you aren’t wearing a corset,” Galatea stated, “the maesters forbid it.” </p><p>Levana chuckled, “will you be a dear and fetch for me the dress that I received from Baela a few months ago?” </p><p>Galatea nodded before scurrying to the princess’ wardrobe to retrieve the dress. Levana looked at herself in the mirror before smiling to herself. <br/><br/></p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"Though it is the great hope of this court that Lord Corlys Velaryon, Grandsire of the Princess Levana, survive his wounds," Otto began, "we gather here with a grim task of dealing with the succession of Driftmark." </p><p>Queen Alicent turned to Aemond, "where is Levana?" </p><p>"She will follow," Aemond responded, "she is not feeling too well after the bleeding." </p><p>Queen Alicent nodded with a sigh before turning her attention back to the Hand of the King who continued to speak. </p><p>"As Hand, I speak with the King's voice on this matter and all others," Otto stated before taking his seat on the throne, "the crown will now hear your petitions beginning with Ser Vaemond of House Velaryon."</p><p>Ser Vaemond all but proudly walked to the center of the room before turning to address Queen Alicent and the Lord Hand, "my Queen, my Lord Hand," he began, "the history of our noble houses extends beyond the Seven Kingdoms to the eve of Old Valyria." </p><p>Otto nodded as Vaemond continued with his speech, "for as long as House Targaryen ruled the skies, House Velaryon ruled the seas and when the Doom fell upon Valyria, our houses became the last of their kind."</p><p>The members of the court seemed to be listening intently though a history lesson was not what they had come for. </p><p>"Our forebearers came to this new land with full knowledge that if they were to fail, it would be the end to their blood and their name," Vaemond stated before taking a deep breath, "I have spent years defending my brother's seat and I am Lord Corlys' kin, his own blood." </p><p>The Velaryon would then turn to Princess Rhaenys and Baela, both of whom questioned his integrity in questioning the line of Driftmark's succession, "the true, impeachable blood of House Velaryon runs through my veins."</p><p>"As it does in my eldest daughter and sons, the trueborn children of Ser Laenor Velaryon," Princess Rhaenyra interjected, "if you cared so much about the blood of your house, Ser Vaemond, you would not be so bold as to supplant its rightful heir," she added before turning to the Velaryon with disdain in her eyes.</p><p>"If you only speak for yourself and your own ambition--" </p><p>"You will have a chance to make your own petition, Princess Rhaenyra," Queen Alicent rebutted, "do Ser Vaemond the courtesy of allowing his to be heard." </p><p>Ser Vaemond, with a smug smile, turned to Rhaenyra, "what do you know about Velaryon blood, princess?"</p><p>Rhaenyra kept silent. </p><p>"You've so boldly abandoned your own child with Velaryon blood to be left in the care of the Queen that even if I cut my veins and show it to you," Vaemond chuckled, "you wouldn't recognize it." </p><p>Rhaenyra still kept silent as Vaemond continued, "this is about the survival of my house and not yours." </p><p>The Velaryon would then look back at the Queen and the Hand, "this is a matter of blood, not ambition as I place the continuation of the survival of my house and line above all." </p><p>Vaemond took a deep breath, "I humbly place myself before you as my brother's successor, the Lord of Driftmark and the Lord of the Tides." </p>

<p>Levana listened to the petitions of Ser Vaemond from beyond the doors of the Great Hall. Her hands were balled into fists as she listened - how bold of him to even mention her against Princess Rhaenyra. There was a certain anger that Levana felt as her granduncle used her to defend his own claim - she would have to get back at him later on.</p><p>The princess nodded for Ser Nandor to open the doors of the Great Hall but they were stopped by the sound of a cane walking toward them. Levana turned her head to see that her grandsire, King Viserys, was walking to the Great Hall.</p><p>"My granddaughter," King Viserys called as Levana walked to him. She hated seeing her grandsire in such a condition. In truth, she was also confused as to why her grandsire's condition had worsened so fast in the span of just two years. He was still strong during the birth of Aemma and Baelon and it saddened her that he couldn't even bear to stand for long anymore.</p><p>"I am here, grandsire," Levana smiled, holding him up as they walked to the door together. The King took a look at her and smiled, "Velaryon colors do look beautifully on you, Levana."</p><p>The princess wore a sea-green dress that had gold details along its bodice and gold embroidery through the skirt and the sleeves. It was a dress that Baela had sent to her as a gift from months prior and she couldn't think of an occasion to wear it other than today.</p><p>"Shall we, grandsire?" Levana asked as King Viserys nodded. The princess would signal for the knights to open the doors as she stood behind the King.</p><p>"King Viserys of House Targaryen, the First of His Name, King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm," Ser Nandor announced as the King began to walk, Levana walked behind him; making sure to be ready if her grandsire needed assistance.</p><p>"Princess Levana of House Targaryen," Ser Nandor began, "the second-in-line to inherit the throne."</p><p>Levana walked proudly in the colors of House Velaryon. The interaction between Ser Vaemond, the Queen, and the Hand not going unnoticed by the princess as she looked over at her mother and brothers with a smile.</p><p>The princess stopped to stand by Princess Rhaenys, holding her hand as the King continued toward the throne. From the corner of her eye, she saw the look of shock on the face of her husband and the Queen. While she was almost certain that she would be questioned about it, she will stand by her family.</p><p>"I will sit on the throne today," King Viserys stated as the Hand nodded in acknowledgment, "Your Grace."</p><p>The King struggled to walk up the steps of the throne, Ser Nandor walked to help him but the King refused. Levana was to run to his aid when he stopped at the steps but she was beaten by her stepfather. Daemon escorted the King to the throne and placed the fallen crown upon his head before returning to Rhaenyra's side.</p><p>Princess Rhaenys held Levana's hand as the King began, "I must admit my confusion as I do not understand why petitions are being heard of a settled succession."</p><p>From the corner of her eye, Levana saw that Lucerys was smiling at her mouthing, "thank you, Ana."</p><p>The princess smiled, "you're welcome, Luke."</p><p>"The only one present who might offer a keener insight into Lord Corlys' wishes is Princess Rhaenys," King Viserys stated as Princess Rhaenys held her head high, "indeed, Your Grace."</p><p>Rhaenys walked to the center of the room, smiling at Levana before looking back at the King, "it was ever my the will of my husband that Driftmark passes through Ser Laenor and to his trueborn son, Lucerys Velaryon," she stated, "he has never changed his mind nor has my support of him."</p><p>Levana smiled at her younger brother as Baela held her hand tightly.</p><p>"As a matter of fact, Princess Rhaenyra informed me of her desire to marry her sons Jace and Luke to Lord Corlys' granddaughters, Baela and Rhaena," Princess Rhaenys added, "a proposal to which I heartily agree."</p><p>"Well, the matter is settled," King Viserys stated, "again."</p><p>Lord Vaemond turned to his grandniece, "what say you about this, Princess Levana, the trueborn Velaryon?"</p><p>"My King," Levana spoke, "if I may."</p><p>"Princess Levana," King Viserys gestured for her to speak.</p><p>"I will not take sides, Ser Vaemond," Levana began, "I will only stand for the wishes of my grandsire, Lord Corlys."</p><p>"You are the only one in your family to be of Velaryon blood," Ser Vaemond stated, "surely the purity of our blood will not end with you or your brothers."</p><p>Levana chuckled, "how bold of you to assume that the line will end with me or my brothers so you can defend your claim to the Driftwood Throne?"</p><p>Vaemond glared at Levana, <b>"and how are you to secure your claim on the Iron Throne when your mother has yet to name you her proper heir and your brother, Jacaerys, is left without inheritance?"</b></p><p>Levana was seething.</p><p><b>"Then if it pleases you and everyone present today,"</b> Levana began, <b>"once I am to take the Iron Throne, my younger brother, Jacaerys, shall inherit the title of Prince of Dragonstone," </b>she smirked as Vaemond looked at her in disbelief.</p><p>
<b>"My King, Princess Rhaenyra, if it pleases you, I shall pass on Dragonstone to Jacaerys, my younger brother, and he shall rule it as its prince."</b>
</p><p>"You cannot do that, princess," Otto stated.</p><p>"And why not?" Levana asked. The Hand looked at the floor and then back at Levana, "Dragonstone is the Targaryen seat, and your brother--"</p><p><b>"My brother is a Targaryen by our mother and her father before her,"</b> Levana interjected, <b>"that is undeniable."</b></p><p>"You say that your brother's maternal heritage is undeniable," Vaemond chuckled, "in a way, you are admitting that they are not of Velaryon blood."</p><p><b>"Careful, Ser Vaemond,"</b> Aemond spoke up,<b> "you forget who you are talking to."</b></p><p>Levana raised her hand, "do not twist my words in an attempt to help your claim if there was any, Ser Vaemond."</p><p>
<b>"You say that you do not take sides and yet here you are."</b>
</p><p>"Yes, I did not take sides," Levana smiled, "I came here today to stand for the will of my Grandsire, Lord Corlys Velaryon, and I have done that by supporting Prince Lucerys' claim to the Driftwood Throne."</p><p>"You gave Dragonstone to your brother!"</p><p>"It will not immediately take effect," Levana stated, "my mother is yet to inherit the Iron Throne, therefore, my reign as Queen will not be for years and my brother will not inherit Dragonstone until I am crowned."</p><p>"Little wench," Vaemond hissed as Aemond stepped forward, "<b>again, Ser Vaemond, you forget who you are talking to."</b></p><p>"You can question matters that relate to Driftmark but you are in no position to question Dragonstone as you are not a Targaryen," Levana stated before looking at the Hand, <b>"even the Hand does not have power over our ancestral seat unless the King wills it."</b></p><p>King Viserys had enough of the talking and sighed, "it is settled and I hereby reaffirm Prince Lucerys of House Velaryon as heir to Driftmark, the Driftwood Throne, and the next Lord of the Tides," King Viserys spoke.</p><p>Princess Rhaenys returned to Levana and Baela's side, holding both their hands as Ser Vaemond turned to question the King.</p><p>"You would break law and years of tradition to install your daughter and granddaughter as heir," Ser Vaemond spoke up, "yet you dare tell me who deserves to inherit the name Velaryon."</p><p>Levana faced Ser Vaemond with a glare as the male continued to speak, "no, I will not allow it."</p><p><b>"Allow it?"</b> King Viserys asked,<b> "do not forget yourself, Vaemond."</b></p><p>"That is no true Velaryon!" Vaemond pointed at Lucerys, "and certainly no nephew of mine."</p><p>"Go to your chambers," Rhaenyra stated, "you've said enough."</p><p>"If I were to cut open my veins, Ser Vaemond, you would only see red," Levana stated, "your argument on identifying Velaryon blood is useless because we are all of the Blood of the Dragon."</p><p>Aemond would then go to Levana's side to pull her away from her grandmother. Levana reluctantly left their side to be brought over to his family's side.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Aemond asked in a hushed whisper, "I will not allow this man to get what he wants," Levana responded.</p><p>"Lucerys is my trueborn grandson and you are no more than the second son of Driftmark," King Viserys stated with disdain in his voice.</p><p>"You may run your house as you see fit but you will not decide the future of mine," Vaemond said in defense, "my house survived the Doom and a thousand tribulations aside."</p><p>"You've said enough, Lord Vaemond," Levana stated. Queen Alicent turned to her and placed a finger upon her lips, "do not interfere, Eva, you've done enough."</p><p>"I will not see it end on the account of this..." Vaemond stopped. From where she was standing, she heard her stepfather say something along the lines of <b>"say it"</b>. But she couldn't be so sure when she could hear the whispers of the members of the court as well.</p><p>Aemond held Levana's hand tightly as Vaemond looked at Rhaenyra with a smile before turning to Levana. The princess couldn't stand the smug look on his face when he turned his back to her to address her mother again.</p><p><b>"Her children are bastards!"</b> Ser Vaemond exclaimed, "and she is a whore."</p><p><b>"And you,"</b> Ser Vaemond pointed at Levana,<b> "you bring shame to House Velaryon for allowing those bastards to inherit Driftmark!"</b></p><p>Rhaenys stepped in front of Levana and glared at Vaemond, "Lord Corlys will not have you blame his granddaughter for such a thing!"</p><p>Levana could see her brothers' reactions and shook her head, hoping for one of them to see her so that they wouldn't do anything brash. But it was to no avail. She tried to run to their side but Aemond shook his head and held her hand tightly, "do not, you won't be helping them at this point."</p><p>"I will have your tongue for that," King Viserys threatened as Levana successfully managed to escape from Aemond's grasp to run in front of her grandsire. Before she could reach her mother, she heard loud gasps from the other people in the court.</p><p>Levana stopped midway in the realization that something had splattered upon her and her dress. Aemond quickly rushed to her side as the body of Ser Vaemond fell to the ground.</p><p>"Eva," Aemond called, "shit," he muttered as he saw the trail of blood that was left on Levana's dress. There was even some near her face which Aemond wiped off with his sleeve. Levana looked at her dress and saw that it had been tainted with Ser Vaemond's blood. She was struck with fear as she looked up and saw Daemon wiping his sword with his clothes.</p><p>"He can keep his tongue," Daemon smiled as Aemond helped Levana stand. The princess was still in shock at what just transpired.</p><p>Her granduncle was killed in front of her - and the entire court at that - and the proprietor was her stepfather.</p><p>"Little moon," King Viserys stood up, "are you--"</p><p>The King groaned in pain as the Queen hurriedly went to his aid, calling for the guards as Aemond wrapped his arms around Levana in an attempt to soothe her. The princess was shaking - never in her life that she expected to see someone be killed in front of her.</p><p>
<b>Her dress was stained with his blood.</b>
</p><p>"Ana," Princess Rhaenys approached her. Immediately, the younger princess wrapped her arms around her grandmother.</p><p>"It's alright, Ana," Rhaenys whispered, "it's alright, it's done."</p><p>Ser Nandor quickly went to Levana's aid, blocking the view from the other members of the court while Princess Rhaenys tried to soothe the shaking Levana. Aemond looked at his wife with worry as they tried to help her stand but she was still shaking all over.</p><p>"Allow me," Ser Nandor volunteered but Aemond stopped him and carried his wife in his arms.</p><p>"Excuse us, Princess Rhaenys," Aemond bowed, "I'll see to it that Levana is taken care of."</p><p>"Summon Galatea," Aemond commanded, "tell her to draw a bath and prepare clothes that the princess can use for supper."</p><p>The knight nodded as the prince began to walk to their chambers, ignoring the stares that he received from his mother and grandfather. The prince would keep silent as the princess did the same, the entire way back to their chambers, Levana was still silent and Aemond couldn't help but worry.</p><p>"I know that it is much to take," Aemond whispered as he entered their chambers, he took a seat on their bed with the princess still in his arms. The prince held her tighter and kissed her forehead, "we don't have to talk."</p><p>Levana looked up at him and began to sob into his chest.</p><p>This was going to take a while but Aemond doesn't mind, he would rather he would be able to hold her like this and comfort her before they would have to face the crowd again. </p>

<p>Aemond would sit with Levana in their chambers the entire afternoon. Even when the princess was sitting in her bath, the prince never left her side. Levana would talk to him from time to time but the conversations were always short and then silence would follow right after.</p><p>This was the first time that Levana had seen something like this and was in shock. The shaking went away after she hopped into the bath but she still couldn't get the imagery of Ser Vaemond's death out of her head.</p><p>By the time that Levana was to dress, Aemond was sitting in the nursery with their children. He got dressed first and was now overseeing the dressing of his children by the maids. He had a book in his hands, it was his and Levana's favorite growing up and he still hasn't found the heart to let it go.</p><p>"Pa," Baelon called as he waddled up to Aemond, the prince set his book down and looked at his son, "yes, Baelon?"</p><p>"Ma, where?" Baelon asked as Aemond picked him up and placed him on his lap, "your mother is still getting dressed. The prince looked over at Aemma who was in a green dress, a contrast to the yellow that her brother wore which made Aemond raise a brow.</p><p>"Change Aemma's dress," Aemond instructed as the nurse looked up at him, "the Queen ordered for the princess to wear green, Your Grace," she responded as the prince shook his head.</p><p>"Change it," Aemond stated in finality, "Princess Levana will not like that."</p><p>The nurse finally conceded and bowed before walking out of the room to fetch a new dress for the princess. Aemond returned to his book as Baelon took a seat on the floor and played with some of the toys that were left scattered on it. Aemma, on the other hand, resigned to taking a seat beside her father and looking into the book that he was reading.</p><p>"Pa," Aemma looked at the book, "wanna read about gramma!"</p><p>"Which one then?" Aemond chuckled, "though, I doubt there is anything about my mother or Princess Rhaenyra."</p><p>"Name!" Aemma pointed to herself.</p><p>"Oh," Aemond said in realization, "Queen Aemma, is it?"</p><p>Aemma nodded but Aemond shook his head, "I don't think there's anything on her in this old book either but we can ask your mother for stories about her."</p><p>The little princess nodded as she joined her older twin on the floor to play with him.</p><p>"Aemond?"</p><p>Helaena walked into the room, looking around for this brother who stood up from the couch and crossed her arms, "what is it now?"</p><p>"Eva wants to see you," Helaena smiled, "she has something that she wants to talk to you about."<br/><br/></p><p>Aemond nodded as the nurse walked back into the room to help Aemma get dressed in something different. The prince instructed the nurse to keep an eye on their children before heading back to their chambers. There was a sense of uneasiness in Aemond's chest as he arrived at their door.</p><p>"Eva?" Aemond called, knocking on the door thrice, "may I come in, love?"</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>Levana's response was quiet as the prince opened the door. Levana sat on their bed, a look of worry in her eyes as Aemond sat beside her and took her hand in his.</p><p>"What is it, Eva?"</p><p>"Do you remember what I asked of you at the dinner after the birth of our children?"</p><p>Aemond was dreading that. He didn't speak much of it nor did he want to remember it. In truth, he had hoped that Levana forgot about it but as it turns out, she hasn't, and now it's come back to haunt him even more.</p><p>"I do," Aemond sighed, "you asked me if I would be willing to run away with our children if things ever went south with your mother's coronation."</p><p>"I want to run away now, Aemond," Levana sighed, "I have a bad feeling that the death of my granduncle will lead to consequences that will affect us greatly."</p><p>"Eva."</p><p>"I don't want our children to suffer," Levana stated, "I want us to live a free life, Aemond, we're facing consequences of actions that we have no direct involvement with."</p><p>"Levana," Aemond placed a hand on her cheek, "we cannot do that."</p><p>"I want to protect our family, Aemond."</p><p>"As do I," Aemond stated, "you are my priority and as your husband, I have a duty to all of you but to abandon our extended family?"</p><p>"My father once told me that a wise sailor flees the storm as it gathers," Levana stated, "we need to flee, Aemond, before everything turns to madness."</p><p>"My love," Aemond sighed, "we are not sailors, we are dragons."</p><p>"You are the dragon," Levana stated, "I have the blood of a sailor in me."</p><p>"Eva, be reasonable."</p><p>"Aemond, I fear for our lives," Levana reasoned, "I don't want us to be collateral damage to a war for the crown."</p><p>"Why do you believe that there would be a war?"</p><p>"I see it in my dreams, Aemond," Levana responded, "my dreams become more vivid every time and I do not want to reach a point where I dream of the death of my own children."</p><p>The princess began crying and Aemond took her into his arms, embracing her tightly as she sobbed into his chest. The prince knew for a long time how the princess' dreams would affect her but he did not expect them to hold this much weight over her.</p><p>It pained him to see his wife like this.</p><p>"Tell you what," Aemond began, "the moment that things go south, we will run away."</p><p>"Can't we just do it now, Aemond?"</p><p>"Eva, they will be suspicious and they will send for us," Aemond sighed, "they'll be able to find us easier if we run now."</p><p>The princess took a deep breath. As much as she wanted to run now, Aemond was right.</p><p>"You have to swear to me that we will run if things go south," Levana said, "swear it on our marriage and on the lives of our children."</p><p>"I swear it," Aemond promised as Levana broke from his embrace to look into his eye, "I swear it, Levana," he repeated before pulling his wife into a kiss.</p><p>It was a comfort to Levana that Aemond was willing to grant her request. Though, only time will tell if they're able to push through with such a plan.</p>

<p>Levana sat in her mother's room with her brothers in an attempt to calm herself down before supper. Aemond suggested that she spend time with her family before they had to return to Dragonstone once more - a bitter fact that the princess had to live with.</p><p>"Ana," Joffrey called as he walked up to his older sister with a small smile, "when are you going to come home with us?"</p><p>Levana's heart sank.</p><p>"Joff, this is where Ana lives now," Jacaerys stated as he picked up Baelon from the floor, "this is where she, Aemma, and Baelon belong."</p><p>"I wish you wouldn't put it that way, Jace," Levana requested, "my heart is still where my mother and brothers are."</p><p>"Your heart belongs to Aemond," Lucerys teased, "it always has ever since we were younger."</p><p>"Hey!" Levana chuckled, "that's not true!"</p><p>"Says you," Jacaerys laughed, "you would spend so many hours with him in the library and you've probably spent every waking hour with him when you moved to the Red Keep."</p><p>"That's an exaggeration," Levana crossed her arms, "we had our lessons to attend to, and even now that we share a bed, I only ever see him at meals and when we are to sleep."</p><p>"Is it difficult?" Lucerys asked, "marriage?"</p><p>"I'm sure that you two need not worry about it," Levana smiled, "you are both close with Rhaena and Baela, are you not?"</p><p>"Still, Ana," Lucerys sighed, "marriage is a different matter."</p><p>"You have it good, Ana," Jacaerys sighed, "you and Aemond really do love each other."</p><p>"We didn't realize until late," Levana reasoned.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Jacaerys asked, "nobody is blind here, Ana, we all know that the both of you harbored feelings for each other even before you both realized it."</p><p>"That's what we've been told," the princess chuckled, "still, we do not see it that way."</p><p>"How is it then?" Lucerys asked, "in all honesty?"</p><p>"It's wonderful," Levana smiled, "though, I will not have you imagining a life that's full of laughter and happiness as you will have moments where you will need to make tough decisions and moments that you will argue."</p><p>"Aemond fights with you?" Jacaerys raised a brow, "I shall have to give him a piece of my mind."</p><p>"Jace," Levana sighed, "fighting and arguing are normal in a relationship and even in a marriage, it's how you handle it that makes a difference."</p><p>"You and Aemond make marriage look perfect," Lucerys muttered.</p><p>"Boys," Levana took a deep breath, "there is no such thing as a perfect marriage."</p><p>"But you two make it look that way!" Lucerys mumbled.</p><p>"Aemond and I don't have a perfect marriage," Levana admitted, "no one does but what makes it close to perfect is our willingness to make things work and our determination to fix our problems when it arises."</p><p>The boys were silent for a while as Jacaerys took a seat on one of the chairs with Baelon sitting on his lap. Lucerys, on the other hand, took a seat next to Levana and leaned his head on her shoulder.</p><p>"Aemond and I love each other, yes," Levana smiled, "but love is not the only thing that makes a marriage work because if you or your wife does not have the willingness or the desire to make things better then you will achieve nothing."</p><p>"Baelon and Aemma are lucky to have you as parents," Jacaerys smiled as he tickled his nephew who laughed loudly, "they must be so spoiled."</p><p>"I learned from watching Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys," Levana smiled, "I also learned just a little bit from mother and father which is what you both should do as well, be willing to learn about new things."</p><p>The three boys looked at each other with a smile as Joffrey made his way to Levana and hugged her, Lucerys did the same as the princess wrapped her arms around her brothers tightly.</p><p>"I know, deep in my heart, that the both of you will make fine husbands," Levana smiled, "I raised you so there shouldn't be a problem."</p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys laughed heartily, it's been such a long time since she's been with her brothers this way, and more than anything, she appreciated time with them. It was something that she yearned to have for so long,</p><p>"I wish Aegon and Viserys were allowed to stay with us," Levana said, "I would have loved to meet them."</p><p>Jacaerys furrowed his brows, "why aren't they here anyhow?"</p><p>"Daemon," Levana responded, "who else?"</p><p>"He's not worth it, Ana," Lucerys squeezed his sister's hand as Levana turned to him.</p><p>"I know, Luke, but mother seemed to think that he is," Levana mused, "I never would've been abandoned at Driftmark if he weren't."</p><p>"Mother talks about you a lot, you know," Jacaerys defended, "she cares about you, Ana."</p><p>"I have no doubt that mother is trying her best," Levana stated, "I just wish that she tried harder for me in Daemon's presence."</p><p>Lucerys and Jacaerys looked at each other with frowns on their faces as Levana stood up from the couch to take Baelon from her younger brother. The princess walked to the door with the babe in her arms as Aemma waddled toward them, reaching up to hold Levana's hand.</p><p>"I love all of you very dearly," Levana stated, "I hold all of you close to my heart, and I will protect you all with my life but you have to understand that my relationship with mother is beyond repair now."</p><p>"Ana," Jacaerys sighed, "we understand and we respect that but we just want you to know that she still cares for you very much and she worries for you."</p><p>"Especially since you're in the Red Keep," Lucerys whispered.</p><p>"I am well-loved and protected in the Red Keep," Levana stated, "the Queen and the King are my allies here and they have never turned their back on me," she added before opening the door and closing it. The princess began to walk to their children's rooms, her heart heavy with the fact that things might no longer be the same with her brothers as well.</p><p>"Ma?" Aemma called, "wanna play."</p><p>Levana nodded and walked into her children's room, she stood by the door, shocked to see that her younger half-brothers were there with their mother.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Rhaenyra mumbled, "the nurses said we could stay here for the time being while you were with your brothers."</p><p>"I don't understand why you couldn't stay in your chambers," Levana stated, "I would have loved to meet my brothers."</p><p>Rhaenyra smiled slightly before standing up and gesturing towards the two boys seated on the floor, "this is Aegon and Viserys."</p><p>Levana smiled, settling her own children down so she could approach her younger brothers. At first, the two were hesitant to go over to her but the princess was the one who approached them, sitting beside them on the floor as her own children waddled toward them.</p><p>"Hello," Levana greeted, "I'm Levana, your older sister."</p><p>Aegon and Viserys looked at her tentatively before smiling at her curiously. Levana then gestured toward her children, "this is Aemma and Baelon, your niece and nephew," she smiled, "though I doubt you would be able to comprehend who they are at this age," she chuckled as Rhaenyra did the same.</p><p>"Have you given thought to what you are to name the babe that is coming?" Rhaenyra asked as Levana shook her head, "Aemond and I discussed that we would name the babe when they arrive."</p><p>"You and my brother are good for each other," Rhaenyra smiled, "I wish I was here to see you both grow in love."</p><p>"Well, mother, if it's any consolation," Levana looked up at her, "we've always been in love."</p><p>"That brings me comfort," Rhaenyra stated, "at least I know that you have Aemond by your side."</p><p>Levana nodded, "he's an amazing husband and father," she assured, "you don't have to worry about me anymore, mother."</p><p>"Ana," Rhaenyra began, "I apologize for not being the best mother to you and for everything that I have done to wrong you."</p><p>Levana took a deep breath, "I appreciate the apology, mother, and in truth, I have made peace with it but it will take me a while to forgive."</p><p>"I am willing to wait," Rhaenyra promised, "just as I was willing to wait for my daughter to be born to me and for her to take her firsts."</p><p>Just as Levana was about to speak, Ser Nandor opened the door to the room, bowing at the two princesses who stood in attention. The knight bowed his head in apology before turning to Princess Levana with a small smile, "supper is ready, Your Graces."</p><p>Levana nodded in acknowledgment before walking toward the door, signaling for her mother to follow. As the two princesses made their way out of the room, the nurses came running in to watch the younger royals while their parents were having supper. On the other hand, Levana and Rhaenyra walked toward the dining room, silence between the both of them as they arrived at the hall.</p><p>Levana took a deep breath.</p><p>How she dreaded having supper with her entire family. She knew that it was not going to be pretty.</p>

<p>Levana walked beside her mother into the dining room where their family waited. Aemond was by the end of the table talking to Aegon when they walked in; immediately, the Prince walked toward his wife, taking her hand in his and placing a kiss on her knuckles.</p><p>The princess turned to her mother who nodded with a small smile as Aemond whisked Levana away.</p><p>"You didn't have to do that," Levana whispered as Aemond smirked, "you looked uncomfortable and as your husband, it is my duty to ensure your comfort," he responded before placing a kiss on Levana's cheek.</p><p>The doors to the dining room opened once more to reveal guards, carrying the seat of the King. Those who were seated stood up in respect as the King was settled into his place beside Queen Alicent and Princess Rhaenyra.</p><p>Just as one of the helpers was to assist Levana with her seat, Aemond raised a hand, "I will assist her," he stated as Levana smiled and took a seat. Aemond pushed her chair closer to the table before taking his own seat beside her.</p><p>There was an unmistakable and familiar feeling of tension in the air as the King began to speak, "how good it is to see you all together tonight."</p><p>Queen Alicent turned towards the King with a small smile, "a prayer before we begin?"</p><p>The King nodded and the Queen cleared her throat. Levana placed her hands on the table while Aemond held one of his wife's hands in his. Levana smiled slightly as the Queen looked around the table before nodding.</p><p>"May the Mother smile down on this gathering with love," Queen Alicent began, "may the Smith mend the bonds that have been broken for too long," she paused as sighed deeply.</p><p>"And to Vaemond Velaryon, may the gods give him rest."</p><p>There were a few moments of silence before the King lifted his head and began to speak, "this is an occasion for celebration it seems as my grandsons, Jace and Luke will marry their cousins, Baela and Rhaena - further strengthening the bond between our houses."</p><p>Levana looked toward his siblings and sisters with a smile. Jacaerys looked at his older sister and nodded to her as the King continued to speak.</p><p>"A toast to the young princes and their betrothed," the King stated as Levana raised her cup with her other hand, "here, here!"</p><p>"Well done, Jace," Aegon began, "you'll finally get to lie with a woman," he said.</p><p>"Aegon," Levana called, "not here."</p><p>"Let us toast as well to Prince Lucerys who will be the future Lord of the Tides and to Prince Jacaerys who will rule as the future Prince of Dragonstone."</p><p>"Here, here," Rhaenyra raised her glass to her sons as those around the table did the same.</p><p>"I have no doubt that you both will be great," Levana spoke as Aemond squeezed her hand before taking a sip from his own cup.</p><p>"I do hope that you know how the act is done," Aegon turned to Jacaerys, "at least in principle and where you put your cock and all that--"</p><p>"Leave it be, cousin," Baela responded.</p><p>"You can play the jester if you wish but hold your tongue in front of my betrothed," Jacaerys hissed as Aegon raised his hands in defeat before turning his attention back to his cup.</p><p>"An uncontrollable tongue," Levana sighed as Aemond chuckled, "you know how he is," he whispered before kissing Levana's cheek. He looked at the ring on his wife's finger with a smile as Levana looked at him warmly.</p><p>"It both gladdens my heart and fills me with sorrow to see these faces around the table," King Visersys began as he slowly stood up from his chair, "the faces most dear to me in all the world yet grown so distant from each other in the years past."</p><p>Everyone listened to King Viserys attentively as he pulled off the half mask from his face. It broke Levana's heart to see her grandfather in such a condition.</p><p>"My own face is no longer a handsome one if it ever was," King Viserys continued, "but tonight, I wish for you to see me as I am," he added. Levana glanced at his husband who looked at his father blankly. Levana, however, knew that Aemond cared for the King - he just didn't like to show it.</p><p>"Not just a king but your father, your brother, your husband, and your grandsire," King Viserys sighed, "who may not, it seems, walk for much longer among you," he continued as he dropped the mask on the table.</p><p>"Let us no longer hold ill feelings in our hearts," the King glanced at each one of them, "the crown cannot stand strong if the House of the Dragon remains divided!"</p><p>He was right. Levana always believed that her grandfather wanted only the best for their family and it saddens her that her family did not see things the way that the King did.</p><p><b>"Set aside your grievances,"</b> King Viserys stated, <b>"if not for the sake of the crown then for the sake of this old man who loves you all so dearly."</b></p><p>Princess Levana squeezed her husband's hand as the King took his seat back. Aemond looked at his wife with a worried expression yet Levana just shook her head as Rhaeynra stood up.</p><p>"I wish to raise my cup to Her Grace, the Queen," Princess Rhaenyra began, "I love my father but I must admit that no one has stood more loyally by his side than his good wife who tended to him with unfailing devotion, love, and honor," she continued before turning her to Levana, "she has also treated my Levana as her own and loved her as her own."</p><p>Levana looked at her mother with a small smile before Princess Rhaenyra looked at the Queen again, "for that, she has my thanks and my apology."</p><p>Queen Alicent took a deep breath, "your graciousness moves me deeply, Princess," she acknowledged, "we are both mothers and we love our children."</p><p>The princess watched the exchange between her mother and the Queen. It saddened her heart to remember that they were once such good friends but have been torn apart by the gods will.</p><p>"We have more in common than we sometimes allow," the Queen said in finality.</p><p>Levana smiled as Aemond did the same. They both had a cup in their hands as Queen stood up, "I raise my cup to you and to your House," she began, "you will make a fine Queen as will Levana after you," she continued before smiling at Rhaenyra and then looking warmly at Levana.</p><p>After their drinks, there was a short pause before Aegon stood up and approached Baela. He took the pitcher of wine from her side and began to pour himself a drink, "I regret the disappointment that you will soon suffer," he chuckled, "but if you ever wish to know what it is to be well satisfied, you know who to ask."</p><p>"Aegon!" Levana scolded from her seat, "that's enough!"</p><p>Aegon shrugged as Jacaerys stood up from his seat, slamming his fists on the table. Almost immediately, Aemond also stood up, looking at the Velaryon menacingly.</p><p>"Aemond, please sit down," Levana requested, holding onto her husband's wrist. The prince glared at Jacaerys before chuckling to himself and following the request of his wife who looked at him with a smile, "thank you."</p><p>"I raise my cup to Prince Aegon and Prince Aemond," Jacaerys began as he raised his cup, "we have not seen each other for years but I have fond memories of our youth," he added as Aemond leaned against the back of his chair, listening to the Velaryon prince.</p><p>"As men, I hope we may yet be friends and allies," Jacaerys smiled and looked at his sister, "to you and your family's good health, dear uncles."</p><p>Levana raised a glass to her brother while Aemond took a sip from his glass.</p><p>"Beware the beast beneath the boards."</p><p>Levana turned to Helaena. This was not the first that she's heard the statement from the princess and needless to say, it worried her. The other members of their family always took no heed to Helaena's words but Levana always thought that there was something in them that she did not understand.</p><p>"Well done, my boy," King Viserys commented as Helaena stood up. This was a pleasant surprise to Levana and the Queen because the other princess was often soft-spoken and preferred not to draw attention to herself.</p><p>"I would like to toast to Baela and Rhaena," Helaena began, "they'll be married soon and it isn't so bad because mostly he ignores you unless sometimes when he's drunk," she chuckled before looking at Levana and Aemond.</p><p>Helaena raised her glass, "unless you are blessed to have a bond like Aemond and sister Levana," she added, "their love is the strongest that I have seen."</p><p>"Thank you, Helaena," Levana raised her glass as Otto nodded in agreement, "well done."</p><p>Levana stood up soon after and looked at everyone around the table.</p><p>"I would like to request everyone to bear with me," Levana chuckled, "this might be long."</p><p>"First, a toast to my mother and her husband, Daemon," Levana turned to Princess Rhaenyra, "for supporting each other to thick and thin," she continued before turning to Queen Alicent, "to my mother-in-law, the Queen, and the Hand for being family to me."</p><p>The princess would then turn to her brothers, "to my brothers, Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey, I know that you will grow to be amazing men and great rulers, no doubt."</p><p>Lucerys and Jacaerys raised their cups to their sister who then turned to Baela and Rhaena, "to my cousins and sisters, Rhaena and Baela, I have no doubt that the both of you will carry our Houses with excellence."</p><p>"Hear, hear," Baela smiled as she raised a glass to Levana. Rhaena did the same before the older princess turned to Aegon and Helaena.</p><p>"Save it, sister," Aegon huffed as Levana chuckled.</p><p>"To Aegon and Helaena, both of you have been such close to me throughout these years and I am glad to have you both as my siblings."</p><p>"Thank you, sister," Helaena smiled.</p><p>"To my Grandsire, King Viserys," Levana smiled warmly as the King looked up at her, "you have raised me as your own and I have no words to express how much I am thankful for you."</p><p>"And finally," Levana held Aemond's hand tightly, "to my husband, I toast to you for the years that we had and the years to come, you are my strength and I love you."</p><p>"I love you too," Aemond responded as Levana raised her glass, "a toast to everyone!"</p><p>Those at the table raised their glasses as Levana took a seat. Aemond leaned toward her and placed a kiss on her cheek.</p><p>"Let us have music," King Viserys stated as the band began to play a lively tune.</p><p>The servants continued to serve food to the table as Levana watched her family. It warmed her heart to see them all look so close - for once, there was a sense of normalcy that she always yearned for.</p><p>"Enjoying yourself, Eva?" Aemond asked as he began to pile food onto his wife's plate, the princess turned to him and nodded a response, "you are fussing about me too much, my love."</p><p>"Can I not fuss over my wife?" Aemond raised a brow as he gestured for the plate. The princess nodded in acknowledgment before leaning to kiss her husband's cheek, "I appreciate that you are fussing over myself and our child, my love."</p><p>Jacaerys then stood up from the table, excusing himself from his betrothed, and walked over to Helaena, offering his hand to her for a dance.</p><p>Aemond turned to his older brother with a smirk on his face as Aegon rolled his eyes.</p><p>Levana watched her brother and sister-in-law dance together with a wide smile on her face. She glanced around the table again, watching her family talk and enjoy the night. She met the eyes of her grandfather who smiled at her sadly.</p><p>The princess gave her Grandsire a nod before he turned to his wife. Queen Alicent then alerted for the guards to take the King from the room. Levana abruptly stood up, alerting her mother who did the same.</p><p>"Please sit," Queen Alicent stated as the King was escorted out of the room.</p><p>The servants would then bring in a roasted pig, setting it in front of Levana and Aemond. Almost immediately, the princess looked at her younger brothers who had grins on their faces.</p><p>"Don't even think about it," Levana warned as Lucerys grinned smugly. Aemond took notice of this and smirked at the prince. As hard as Levana tried to stop her brother from laughing, the younger prince only did it more - angering Aemond.</p><p>"Final tribute," Aemond stated, slamming his fist against the table and standing up.</p><p>"Aemond," Levana gritted her teeth as she held her husband's hand. Aemond, on the other hand, chuckled slightly before he raised his cup.</p><p>"To the health of my nephews, Jace, Luke, and Joffrey," Aemond began, Levana squeezed her husband's hand tightly, "don't do it, Aemond, please."</p><p>"Each of them handsome, wise," Aemond looked at Lucerys and Jacaerys before smiling slightly, "strong."</p><p>"Aemond," Queen Alicent called but it fell on deaf ears.</p><p>"Come, let us drain our cups to these three strong boys."</p><p>"Aemond," Levana stood up from her chair, "please do not do this here, and do not ruin this night for me."</p><p>"I dare you to say that again," Jacaerys threatened.</p><p>"Why?" Aemond turned his head to face him, "it was only a compliment unless you do not think of your House to be strong."</p><p>The older prince walked towards Jacaerys who did not hesitate one bit to throw a punch to Aemond's face. Levana watched as Lucerys was pinned down to the table by Aegon and Jacaerys was pushed to the ground by Aemond.</p><p>"Why would you do such a thing in front of all these people?" Queen Alicent scolded as she approached Aemond, "do you have no regard for your wife at all?"</p><p>"I was merely expressing how proud I am of my family, mother," Aemond responded, "Levana knows that much but it seems that her brothers aren't as proud of theirs as I thought."</p><p>Levana almost ran to her siblings who were being held back by the guards. Immediately, she went to Jacaerys, checking on him before turning to look with a glare, "this is what happens when you do not control yourself, Luke," she scolded.</p><p>Just as Jacaerys was supposed to run toward Aemond, Daemon stepped in to stop him.</p><p>"Go to your quarters," Princess Rhaenyra ordered, "now."</p><p>"Go," Levana repeated the order as her brothers and cousins made their way out of the banquet hall. Aemond, on the other hand, was met by the intense stare of Daemon.</p><p>"Stop it," Levana whispered, stepping in between the two Targaryen males, "Aemond, don't do anything," she whispered to her husband who looked down at her and made his way out of the hall.</p><p>Princess Levana turned to the Queen and bowed slightly, "please excuse us," she said before running after her husband.</p><p>So much for a perfect night.</p>

<p>"Aemond!"</p><p>The Targaryen Prince stopped in his tracks, allowing his wife to catch up with him. There was an unmistakable look of disappointment and hurt on Levana's face as she walked up to her husband.</p><p>"Are you expecting an apology?" Aemond asked as Levana shook her head, "I am expecting an explanation," she hissed.</p><p>"What more do I have to say?" Aemond responded, "your bastard of a brother was challenging me."</p><p>"He was just laughing, Aemond!" Levana responded, "let them get away with that because how you responded to it was ten times worse."</p><p>"Oh, let them get away with it, I see," Aemond chuckled, "just how they got away when your brother took my eye from me, is that it?"</p><p>"Aemond, that was a different time."</p><p>"I've had to live without my eye for two decades, Levana," Aemond responded, "and all I did tonight was give your bastard brothers a piece of my mind and I'm suddenly your enemy?"</p><p>"Call them bastards again, Aemond, I dare you."</p><p>"What are you going to do, hm?" Aemond raised a brow, "tell the Queen? Complain to the King?"</p><p>Levana stood there, fuming at how her husband was reacting.</p><p>"Do everything to protect your bastard bro-"</p><p>Aemond was cut off by a hard slap on the face. Levana looked at him with tears in her eyes as she held her hand to her chest.</p><p>"When they were being called bastards as children, Aemond, I couldn't do anything about it," Levana choked on a sob, "I couldn't protect them."</p><p>Aemond stood there, dumbfounded. A part of him couldn't believe that his wife had just slapped him across the face but the stinging on his cheek proved otherwise.</p><p>"But when your parentage was being questioned," Levana took a deep breath, "I did everything that I could to help you just so you wouldn't have to go through what they did, Aemond."</p><p>Aemond remained silent. He wanted to hear what more she had to say.</p><p>"All this because of a childish grudge you have for my brother," Levana stated, "all this because of the Pink Dread."</p><p>Levana wiped the tears from her eyes before looking at her husband, "thank you for ruining what started out as a perfect night for me, Aemond," she smiled slightly, "I'll be sleeping in the children's room tonight."</p><p>"Levana," Aemond finally spoke but the princess raised a hand to stop him.</p><p>"I need time alone."</p><p>With that, the princess walked away from him. Aemond stood there, placing a hand on his cheek as he watched her walk away. He wanted to chase after her but he knew better than to continue an argument. He's never seen his wife that angry before.</p><p>Her anger was justified, of course. Levana did plead with him not to destroy the festive mood of the evening for her.</p><p>Aemond knew just how much Levana waited for a time like this and he ruined it - all because of that smug look on Lucerys' face. He wanted to believe that the reason why the night was ruined was because of his wife's brother but as Levana would always tell him, there was an opposite reaction to everything that they did.</p><p>With a very heavy heart, Aemond began his walk back to their chambers. He would have to wait out the storm while Levana's heart heals and the tension dies down.<br/><br/></p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>It was in the middle of the night when Aemond found himself in the comfort of the library. He couldn't sleep - his confrontation with Levana still weighed heavily in his mind that he couldn't even bother to close his eyes. That's when he decided to head for the library in the hopes to clear his head.</p><p>"Tea?"</p><p>Aemond looked up from his book to see Levana with two cups of tea in her hands. He nodded before closing the book that he was reading and setting it aside. Levana took a seat in front of him and placed the cups on the table.</p><p>"Why are you still awake?" Aemond asked as Levana smiled slightly, "I couldn't find sleep and the thoughts in my head were too much to bear."</p><p>"Would you like to talk about it?" Aemond offered.</p><p>"I can't stop thinking about Grandsire," Levana sighed, "what he did for my mother and brothers yesterday was a testament to his love for them."</p><p>"He has the same love for you," the prince stated, "I wager he would choose you over myself or my siblings anytime."</p><p>"I'm not here to compare, Aemond," the princess responded, "I just couldn't help but think that even after what my mother has done, the King still chose her."</p><p>The prince looked up at Levana who had a nostalgic smile on her face, "even after abandoning her own daughter and for siring," the princess chuckled, "bastards."</p><p>Aemond raised a brow, "you don't have to force yourself to call them that."</p><p>"I know," Levana responded, "I'm just hurt, Aemond."</p><p>"Dare I ask?"</p><p>"All these years," Levana began, "it's always been my brothers and not me, I have no doubt that if it came to, my mother would choose to sacrifice my head over any of my brothers."</p><p>"I won't let her have your head."</p><p>"I don't doubt that one bit," Levana sighed, "it's just that it feels so bad to have fallen out of your own mother's favor."</p><p>Aemond chuckled, "you and I both."</p><p>"The Queen loves you."</p><p>"No, she doesn't," Aemond responded, "the King and the Queen have no love for us."</p><p>Levana kept silent as she took a sip from her tea.</p><p>"The first time that you told me that you loved me was the first that I received that from anyone," Aemond stated, "when you said that, I promised myself that no force on heaven or earth will take you from me and anyone who dares would have to kill me first before they could get to you."</p><p>"Aemond, I never took you for a romantic."</p><p>"I never was," Aemond chuckled, "until I fell in love with you."</p><p>Levana smiled at him as the prince stood up from his seat to walk toward the princess. He knelt in front of her, taking her hands in his and looking into his wife's eyes, "I'm sorry, I know how important that night was for you and I ruined it."</p><p>"You're forgiven," Levana reached to touch his cheek, "I'm sorry that I hurt you."</p><p>"Your Graces."</p><p>Aemond smirked as he turned his head toward Ser Criston who stood behind them with his head low.</p><p>"You better have a good reason to disturb us, Cole," Aemond hissed as Ser Criston nodded, "the King would like to see the princess."</p><p>Levana raised a brow, "this late?"</p><p>"King Viserys said that it was important that you come to him immediately," Ser Criston bowed his head as Levana stood up from her seat and nodded.</p><p>"Our chambers?" Aemond asked as Levana nodded, "I'll meet you there, my prince," she smiled before making her way toward the King's chambers.</p><p>There was an unsettling feeling in the pit of her stomach as she opened the door to her Grandsire's chambers. She looked around the room before walking toward his bed, "Grandsire?"</p><p>King Viserys groaned, "is that you, my little moon?"</p><p>Levana hurriedly went to sit by his side, taking his hand in hers, "I'm here, Grandsire, Levana."</p><p>"Ah," King Viserys smiled slightly, "my favorite."</p><p>Levana smiled slightly. She couldn't help but tear up at her Grandsire's condition. He was once so strong and now he couldn't even sit properly.</p><p>"You needed to see me, Grandsire?"</p><p>"Take the box from under the sculptures," King Viserys instructed as Levana hurriedly made her way toward her Grandsire's masterpiece, a scale model of Valyria. She looked under the table to see a jewel-encrusted box that she took into her hands before returning to the King's side.</p><p>"Is this the one?" Levana asked as she opened the box to reveal a dagger made of Valyrian steel. The princess looked closely at the blade to identify that its hilt had in it a ruby and was made from dragonbone and dragonglass.</p><p>"This once belonged to Aegon the Conquerer," The King managed to say, "before his death, the last of the Valyrian pyromancers hid his song in the steel."</p><p>Levana looked at the dagger again and then at her Grandsire, "I don't understand."</p><p>"From my blood comes the prince that was promised and his will be a song of ice and fire," King Visersys stated as he closed the box and pushed it toward Levana.</p><p>"This blade is yours," King Visersys stated, "use it in your quest for peace."</p><p>"What quest?" Levana asked as she held King Viserys' hand tightly, "what quest, Grandsire?"</p><p>"Your grandmother's vision," The King breathed, "Queen Aemma's dream."</p><p>Levana looked at him with a puzzled expression. Then the realization came crashing into her like a mighty wave.</p><p>
<b>"You are the moon of her vision."</b>
</p><p>She's heard the same statement in one of her visions.</p><p align="center">
<em>
<b>"The moon of your grandmother's vision will rise, Levana."</b>
</em>
</p><p>"Go," King Viserys coughed, "do not let them see you here."</p><p>The princess, although confused, placed a quick kiss on her Grandsire's forehead before fleeing the room and running straight for her own chambers.</p><p>Meanwhile, King Viserys lay in his bed, looking up at the ceiling with a smile.</p><p>
<b>"It is done, my love."</b>

<p>Levana ran as fast as she could back to her chambers. She didn't know what her grandfather wanted her to do by giving her his dagger nor did she know what he meant about a quest for peace but if he had given it to her, there must be a good reason for it.</p><p>Just as Levana made it past her children's chambers, the doors opened. Immediately, the princess' reaction was to look at who it might be while hiding the box behind her. To her surprise, it was her grandmother, Princess Rhaenys.</p><p>"Ana?" Princess Rhaenys looked at her with a puzzled expression, "why are you awake so early?"</p><p>"I was with Aemond in the library," Levana lied. It felt horrible.</p><p>"I was just checking on my grandchildren," Princess Rhaenys smiled, "looking at them gives me much comfort."</p><p>Levana smiled at her grandmother before bowing her head, "I have to return to our chambers, grandma if you excuse me."</p><p>Without even hearing a response, Levana turned away and proceeded her walk back to her chambers. She kept the box close to her chest as she arrived at the door. The princess entered the room and immediately shut it, all while keeping the box safe in her arms.</p><p>The room was empty, save for the noise coming from the bath. Aemond must be there which gave time for Levana to hide the box that her grandfather had given her. Her first thought was to hide it under the bed but she didn't know how safe that was for her so her second thought was to hide it under one of the dressers.</p><p>Hardly anyone checks there except for Galatea. Levana can deal with her if she does come asking about the box.</p><p>After making sure that the box was out of sight, the princess decided to take a peek into the bath.</p><p>Needless to say, she wasn't disappointed.</p><p>Aemond sat in the bath, his eyepatch off as he leaned against the edge of the tub. His arms were on either side of the tub while his head was leaned back against the edge.</p><p>"It's rude to stare."</p><p>Levana chuckled slightly as she walked closer to him, "why are you in the bath this early?"</p><p>"Because you were taking too long," Aemond responded, "I needed to calm myself."</p><p>"Were you hoping for something, Prince Aemond?" Levana asked, taking a seat on the floor and leaning her head against his arm. The prince hummed, "I was hoping that my wife would join me in the tub."</p><p>"You must have a lucky wife," Levana commented, "you're always so thoughtful."</p><p>"No," Aemond responded, "I'm lucky to have her."</p><p>The prince sat up and looked at Levana, "how can you look at me and not see a monster?"</p><p>The princess smiled endearingly and placed a hand on his cheek, "because when I look at you, I see the boy who I would sit with every day in the library," she responded, "you're not a monster, Aemond nor are you as cold as you think you are."</p><p>"How can you see a difference from others?" Aemond asked.</p><p>"Because I've seen and felt the warmth in you, Aemond," Levana replied, "and I've been blessed to know who you really are."</p><p>The prince looked at his wife and leaned closer to her. Levana smiled slightly and met him halfway to capture his lips in a passionate kiss.</p><p>"You are the best of me, Levana," Aemond whispered, "and it is I who has been blessed to have you as a wife."</p><p>"I love you," Levana said as Aemond placed a kiss on her forehead, "I love you, my beautiful bride."</p><p>"Join me?" Aemond asked as Levana chuckled as stepped away from him. She stripped from her robes before joining him in the tub. She sat between his legs and leaned her head on his chest, listening to his heartbeat. Meanwhile, the prince wrapped his arms around Levana, holding her tightly.</p><p>"I could stay like this forever," Levana whispered as Aemond leaned back against the tub to a more comfortable position.</p><p>"I don't mind holding you like this forever," Aemond responded, placing a kiss on the top of Levana's head.</p><p>The two would stay like that for a while - reveling in each other's presence. It also allowed Levana to forget about what her Grandsire asked of her earlier. Being with Aemond gave her a sense of peace - one that she couldn't find anywhere else.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>It was later in the morning hour when a knock came upon Levana's door. The princess had just finished dressing when Galatea opened the door to reveal Ser Westerling. While it relieved Levana to see her oldest friend, he was without his white cloak and armor.</p><p>"Ser Harold?" Levana looked at him with worry, "has something happened?"</p><p>"Princess Levana," Ser Westerling began, "it is of the essence that you find a way to leave King's Landing as soon as possible."</p><p>"What's going on?" Galatea asked as the knight took a deep breath, "Princess Rhaenys is still in the castle and you must leave with her when she returns to Driftmark."</p><p>"Please enlighten me," Levana's worry was becoming worse by the minute, "what happened?"</p><p>"King Viserys is dead."</p><p>The princess' eyes widened, "that can't be, I was just with him earlier."</p><p>"Who else knows that you were with him?" Ser Westerling asked as Levana looked at Galatea, "Aemond and Ser Criston."</p><p><b>"You are no longer safe in the Red Keep or King's Landing, Princess Levana," </b>Ser Westerling stated, "I don't have time anymore and I must leave."</p><p>"Where are you going?" Levana asked, "what's happening?"</p><p><b>"The Hand is planning to usurp the throne with Prince Aegon,"</b> Ser Westerling stated, <b>"I will no longer be here to protect you as I have left my post in the Kingsguard which is why you must also flee."</b></p><p>"I will not flee without my husband," Levana stated as the knight sighed in defeat.</p><p>"For the sake of Prince Baelon and Princess Aemma," Ser Westerling held the princess' hand tightly, "you must find a way to leave as soon as possible."</p><p>Levana turned to Galatea and nodded before embracing the knight.</p><p>"Thank you for your service, Ser Harold," Levana stated as the knight nodded, "it is my hope that I will be able to serve you again, Princess Levana," he responded before hurriedly making his way out of the door. Levana watched as he disappeared into the shadows of the hall.</p><p>"Princess?" Galatea called but Levana couldn't even respond. She talked to her Grandsire earlier and now he was gone.</p><p>The princess was undoubtedly confused as her handmaiden helped her take a seat. She was just informed of the fact that Otto Hightower was to seize the throne from her mother and now she also had to think about leaving King's Landing if she were no longer safe there.</p><p>"Bring Aemond to me," Levana instructed as Galatea nodded, "no one is to know about what Ser Harold told us."</p><p>Galatea nodded and bowed before the princess before making her way out of the door. Levana took this opportunity to calm herself down and to think of a plan. Aemond agreed that he would run away with her when the situation arises but she wasn't sure now of how that would play out if the Hand was trying to seize the throne.</p><p>Levana tried to think of which lords she could approach to help them but her train of thought was interrupted by her husband who marched into the room.</p><p>"Helaena wants to see you and the children," Aemond stated as Levana tried to shake the thoughts away and nodded at him.</p><p>"I'll collect Baelon and Aemma," Levana said as she walked toward the door, Aemond held her hand tightly, "they're already with Helaena," he said as the princess nodded. The two would make their way toward the nursery where Helaena spent most of her time at.</p><p>"You look dazed," Aemond said, "is everything alright?"</p><p>Levana looked at her husband and nodded, "everything is fine, Aemond, I'm just a bit tired."</p><p>"I'm sure a visit to Helaena would help," Aemond said as Levana nodded in agreement. Maybe visiting Helaena would take her mind off things for a while.</p><p>That, however, was not meant to be as they found the Queen and the Hand inside the nursery.</p><p>"Sister," Helaena called as Levana smiled at her. Otto walked toward them, glaring at Levana before looking at Aemond, "bring Princess Levana back to her chambers."</p><p>"Step away from my wife, Grandsire," Aemond stated as the Hand looked at him with disdain before walking out of the room.</p><p>"Bring Levana back, Aemond," The Queen stated, "there is a delicate matter that we need to address."</p><p>Aemond nodded and held onto Levana's arm before making their way back to their chambers, "what's going on, Aemond?" Levana asked as the prince sighed.</p><p>"I have yet to know but please sit tight, my love," Aemond said, "I will get to the bottom of this." </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Moments later, Aemond returned to their chambers. He was quick to change out of his robes while Levana watched him.</p><p>"Where are you going?" Levana asked as Aemond sighed, replacing his usual eyepatch with a simpler one, "I'm going to look for Aegon with Cole," he responded. The prince dressed in simple clothing similar to that of the smallfolk with a hood covering his hair.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>Aemond wrapped his arms around Levana before placing a kiss on her forehead, "King Viserys is dead, Eva," he whispered. While she already knew that because of Ser Harold, the confirmation that her Grandsire was, indeed, dead, made her sob into Aemond's chest.</p><p>The prince could only hold her tightly as Levana cried. There was nothing he could do right now to make things better.</p><p>"Why would you need to look for Aegon?" Levana asked, "we should be flying to Dragonstone and telling my mother about this."</p><p>Aemond fell silent.</p><p>"Aemond?" Levana looked at her husband, "I'll look for the Lord Hand and we should bring my mother to King's Landing immediately."</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Aemond kissed Levana's forehead again before hurriedly making his way out of the room. Before the princess could react, the door was slammed shut.</p><p>"Aemond!" Levana shouted as she tried to open the door to no avail. She was locked inside the room. "Aemond, open the door this instant!" Levana shouted again as she banged her fists against the door.</p><p>Fear and confusion immediately came over the princess as she was left inside her chambers. It must have been only a few moments when the doors were pushed open to reveal Galatea and Ser Nandor.</p><p>"Princess," Ser Nandor called as Levana ran towards the dresser to retrieve the dagger that her Grandsire had given her. She took the weapon in her hands and pointed it toward the two figures.</p><p>"Princess, we have to flee," Galatea stated as she held out a stack of clothes for the princess to wear.</p><p>"I don't understand," Levana looked at them, "where is my husband?!"</p><p>"Prince Aemond is in the streets of King's Landing to look for Aegon," Ser Nandor stated, "they intend to crown Aegon as king."</p><p>"Why?" Levana asked, "my mother is the chosen heir!"</p><p>"Not anymore it seems," Ser Nandor continued, "the Hand stated that King Viserys amended his wishes and has named Prince Aegon as king."</p><p>The princess was in disbelief as she lowered the dagger. Galatea walked to her side and placed the clothes beside her, "we don't have a moment to lose, Your Grace."</p><p>"What about my children?" Levana asked, "I will not leave without Baelon and Aemma."</p><p>"I will ensure their safe passage out of King's Landing, Princess," Ser Nandor stated, "but for now, you and Galatea must board a ship to Dragonstone where you will be safe."</p><p>"Why are you helping me?" Levana asked, "aren't you on the side of the throne?"</p><p>"King Viserys and Ser Harold have entrusted me with the task to protect you," Ser Nandor responded, "I will only take the side that you are on, Princess Levana."</p><p>Levana looked at the both of them and nodded in agreement, "I'll change."</p><p>"Please hurry, My Princess," Galatea requested as Levana nodded before retreating to the bath to change.</p><p>The princess hurriedly changed her clothes into that of the smallfolk. She took a deep breath before walking out of the bath. Galatea looked at her and handed her grandsire's dagger to her which the princess secured safely in the satchel of her belt.</p><p>"Princess, we have a problem," Ser Nandor sighed, "Princess Rhaenys has been locked inside her room."</p><p>Levana took a deep breath, "will you be able to get her when you take the children?"</p><p>"I can try my best," Ser Nandor stated, "but my priority will be Princess Aemma and Prince Baelon."</p><p>The princess nodded as she wore the hood of her clothes and nodded at her handmaiden.</p><p>"Let's be off, princess," Galatea stated as she pushed aside one of Levana's dressers. Ser Nandor helped her to push away any other obstruction to reveal a passageway. The princess' eyes widened as she saw the path that was conveniently in their room.</p><p>"I'll fix everything," Ser Nandor stated, "the both of you have to go."</p><p>Galatea nodded and pulled the princess into the passageway. Levana gasped slightly as the light of the tunnel was cut off and only a torch provided them with light. Galatea led the way as the princess followed closely behind her.</p><p>"Why are you helping me, Galatea?"</p><p>"Because you are my princess," Galatea responded, "I practically raised you, Your Grace, and I will not abandon you."</p><p>"Why is Ser Nandor helping us?"</p><p>"He is at our aid at the request of King Viserys," Galatea responded, "He and Ser Harold were sworn to be your swords," she added.</p><p>"Why was I not made aware of this?"</p><p>"Ser Harold told us that the King didn't know who he had left to trust in the Red Keep," Galatea explained, "that's why Ser Harold, Ser Nandor, and myself were asked to swear fealty to you, Princess Levana."</p><p>"Why me?" Levana asked, "I have nothing to my name when I am not Queen."</p><p>"Princess," Galatea stopped for a while, "if it comes to, you will have the support of Lord Besian and the rest of House Greyjoy."</p><p>"I don't understand," Levana looked at her handmaiden, "I've only met him once."</p><p>"Lord Besian is my older brother," Galatea confessed.</p><p>"How?" Levana furrowed her eyebrows, "why are you my handmaiden when you're supposed to be a lady?"</p><p>"I was not born in the Iron Islands, Your Grace," Galatea stated, "I was born elsewhere when my mother was forced to flee the islands."</p><p>Levana listened. This was the first that she has heard of anything about Galatea's family. She had always kept it close to her heart whenever Levana asked and disclosed nothing about them until today.</p><p>"My brother and I are dragonseeds, Your Grace," Galatea continued, "our mother, by all means, was not trying to find herself a Targaryen or a Velaryon but old traditions die hard."</p><p>"Galatea, I'm so sorry," Levana held the other female's arm tightly, "I didn't know."</p><p>"I didn't want anyone to know, Your Grace," Galatea smiled, "not all dragonseeds are treated with kindness, and my stepfather, Lord Ansel, was not a kind man."</p><p>"What happened to your mother?"</p><p>"She died when we arrived in King's Landing," Galatea took a deep breath, "I was then taken in by the Septa before becoming your handmaiden, My Princess."</p><p>"How did you find Lord Besian again?"</p><p>"I've sent many letters throughout my life to House Greyjoy to no avail," Galatea sighed, "I only ever got a response when my brother became the Iron King."</p><p>"Were you able to see him again?" Levana asked, "apart from my wedding?"</p><p>"During your tenth Name Day," Galatea responded, "if the lords of the Great Houses were not invited then I never would've reunited myself with my brother."</p><p>Galatea began to walk again but Levana stood still. Everything was starting to get overwhelming for her and more than anything, she just wanted the entire ordeal to be over.</p><p>"My lady, we have to leave," Galatea said as she held Levana's hand tightly before leading her through the network of tunnels. They made their exit somewhere in King's Landing - the princess couldn't identify where they were even if she tried. She has never been out of the walls of the Red Keep long enough to know the districts of King's Landing.</p><p>"Stay close to me, Princess," Galatea whispered as she threw the torch into a puddle of water. Levana nodded and followed closely behind her handmaiden as they navigated through the streets.</p><p>"We need to get to the Iron Gate," Galatea said in a hushed voice, "from there, we'll meet with one of the knights of the City Watch that's loyal to Ser Harwin who will grant us safe passage to Duckensdale where we'll board a ship to Dragonstone."</p><p>Levana nodded in agreement. She tried to keep her head low but from the corner of her eye, she saw that they were being followed.</p><p>"Galatea."</p><p>"I know, Your Grace," Galatea responded as she tried her best to evade those who were following them. Levana's eyes were sharp, looking around at her to spot somewhere they could go through and hide.</p><p>"Where are we Galatea?" Levana asked as they walked into an alley and emerged in a less crowded area. The princess looked behind her to see that they'd escaped from their pursuers before walking up to Galatea's side.</p><p>"This is the Street of Silk," Galatea responded, "the Dragonpit is just near here but we cannot go there, Your Grace."</p><p>"Why? We can escape on Vermithor," Levana stated, "I will not leave him behind."</p><p>"If the Hand finds out that you're not in your chambers, the Dragonpit is one of the places that they will suspect first," Galatea responded.</p><p>"You aren't wrong."</p><p>A voice from behind them chuckled as Galatea pursed her lips, "run, princess," she whispered but it was too late. Levana couldn't react fast enough when she was grabbed by the arm by one of their pursuers who she recognized was a part of the Kingsguard.</p><p>"Galatea, run!" Levana stated as she looked toward her handmaiden.</p><p>"I will not leave you!" Galatea responded as she tried her best to evade capture.</p><p>"Leave me behind," Levana said as her captor began to pull her away from the streets, "that is an order!" She shouted as Galatea looked at her and nodded. The handmaiden quickly ran away from the other pursuer, entering one of the streets as Levana was being pulled by the arm.</p><p>"Do you not know who I am?" Levana hissed, "let me go!"</p><p>"Not a chance, Princess," the knight stated, "the Lord Hand has specifically instructed for you to be brought back to him."</p><p>"Why him?" Levana asked as she slowly began to reach for the satchel on her waist. She opened it slightly to grab the hilt of the dagger inside.</p><p>"You are to be kept inside your chambers as Prince Aegon is being crowned," the knight revealed, "he cannot have you wandering about to warn your mother of this."</p><p>Levana glared as she brought out the dagger, cutting the knight across the cheek. The knight hissed in pain as he let go of the princess who took this as an opportunity to run back into the streets.</p><p>She didn't know where she was running to but if there was one thing she knew, it was how to find the Sept of Baelor. By now, she had secured the dagger back inside the satchel - she didn't want it to be an object of interest as she looked around the streets. She tried to navigate through the streets, finally reaching the Sept where she spotted familiar faces.</p><p>Her husband and uncle were having what seemed to be a fist fight was Ser Criston was in the middle of his own fight with Ser Arryk. Levana ran towards Aegon and Aemond, pushing the former to the ground.</p><p>"Eva?!" Aemond shouted as Aegon rushed to attack the princess. Levana was tackled to the ground by Aegon who looked at her with anger on his face, "what the fuck are you doing here?!"</p><p>"Get away from my wife!" Aemond exclaimed as he pulled Aegon away. Levana stood up from the ground, only for her to be grabbed by her pursuers again.</p><p>"Aemond!" Levana called as both princes' hurried to Levana's aid, each delivering a punch to the two knights who held the princess by the arm. As Aemond and Aegon were recovering, Ser Criston took this as an opportunity to grab Aegon by the arm, "the Queen is waiting."</p><p>Aemond looked at his wife and embraced her, "what are you doing out here?"</p><p>"I went to follow you," Levana stated, "one of the guards told me that you went out of the Red Keep," she lied as Aemond looked in the direction of the knights who were knocked down on the ground.</p><p>"I'll find out who sent for them."</p><p>"It was Otto," Levana responded, "Otto sent for them to look for me."</p><p>"I'll figure out why," Aemond said as he held Levana tightly in his arms. They trailed behind Ser Criston and Aegon as they made their way back to the Red Keep.</p><p>"We need to run away, Aemond," Levana whispered, "we're not safe here anymore."</p><p>"Eva, we can't do that, not now."</p><p>"Why?" Levana asked, "you promised me that we would run away the moment that things went sour."</p><p>"Eva, we have to be here for them."</p><p>"Aemond, they are seizing the throne from my mother," Levana started, "this is treason and if we do nothing, we'll be traitors to the crown."</p><p>"We will be safer if Aegon is king," Aemond responded, "if we defect from his council, we won't have anyone to defend us, Levana."</p><p>"Are you agreeing to this?" Levana asked in disbelief.</p><p>"We're staying to keep our children safe." </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Princess Levana was locked inside her chambers while Aemond was having a meeting with his mother. She was pacing across the room, eyeing the dagger that was on the table before she heard the lock on the door starting to be opened. Hurriedly, Levana took the dagger and hid it under one of her pillows and out of sight.</p><p>She tried to calm herself down as she sat on the bed, her heart beating against her chest as Otto Hightower entered the room.</p><p>"Princess," Otto bowed his head, "you were in King's Landing today."</p><p>"You're usurping the throne," Levana stated, "my Grandsire never wished for this."</p><p>"The King amended his wishes as stated by the Queen," Otto replied, "you would do your House and family a favor by staying loyal to Aegon when he is crowned."</p><p>
<b>"I will not stand for this."</b>
</p><p>Otto chuckled, "is that why you tried to flee from King's Landing?"</p><p>"Aemond will hear about this, Lord Hand," Levana said, "and when he does we will--"</p><p>"Prince Aemond will be inaugurated into the King's Small Council," Otto closed the door behind him, "as will you when you bend the knee to Aegon."</p><p><b>"I am Princess Levana of House Targaryen, born of House Velaryon, and the Blood of the Dragon runs deep inside me,"</b> Levana stated, <b>"I am an heir to the Iron Throne and I will bend the knee to no one."</b></p><p>"Then you will risk the safety of your children and yourself," Otto crossed his hands over his chest, "do this for them, Princess."</p><p>
<b>"Fuck you, Otto."</b>
</p><p>"My, my," Otto chuckled, "this was not the outcome that I was hoping for when I proposed your betrothal to the Queen when you and Aemond were much younger."</p><p>"What are you getting at?" Levana asked, her guard up as she walked toward the balcony doors, "my mother was the one who made that proposal."</p><p>"It was Queen Alicent who did," Otto stated, "Queen Alicent and I made a plan to use you to guarantee that Princess Rhaenyra wouldn't make any advances should the arguments for the crown turn into a war."</p><p>"I was a... pawn?" Levana asked, taking a seat on the bed. For a moment, she doubted everything that she's come to know and love.</p><p>Was Aemond's love for her part of this scheme?</p><p>"The Queen loves me as a mother would her child," Levana began to tear up, "I doubt that she had a hand in this."</p><p>"She agreed to the marriage when I had proposed it," Otto stated, "and you are not a pawn, Princess Levana, I prefer to call you a calculated move," he added before opening the door. The princess looked up at him in tears as Otto sighed.</p><p>"Your mother will think twice about any attacks on King's Landing while you and the children are here," Otto stated, "best you make up your mind, princess."</p><p>With that, the Hand walked out of the room. Levana was about to make a break for it when the doors closed abruptly. She could hear the door being locked again which left her to her own devices once more.</p><p>She tried to think of a plan to escape but she only knew of the passageway that Galatea brought her through. Even then, she wouldn't be able to navigate through it on her own and she would also have to take her children with her. That, in itself, was no easy task.</p><p>The door to her chambers opened again to reveal Ser Nandor who looked at the princess with a worried expression.</p><p>"Is Galatea alright?" Levana asked as Ser Nandor nodded, "we will have an opening tonight, Princess, we can take the children and escape."</p><p>Levana shook her head before taking out a letter and handing it to the knight, "take this and make sure that Galatea reaches the Iron Islands safely then you can return to Dorne."</p><p>"I cannot leave you behind, princess," Ser Nandor stated.</p><p>"I have nothing to my name if my mother does not seat the throne, Ser Nandor," Levana said, "I cannot offer you anything in exchange for your loyalty."</p><p>The knight sighed deeply before taking the letter in his hands, "it was never a question of what you had, Princess Levana, it was a question of what you are willing to do," he responded before placing the letter in his belt.</p><p>"We will come back for you," Ser Nandor vowed as Levana nodded. Though, deep in her heart, she knew that she would rather meet her demise first than have the people she cared for meet their end because of her.</p><p>The knight bowed his head before leaving the room. Once again, Levana was left with the company of her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>It was nightfall when Aemond returned to their chambers. He was prepared for the backlash of his actions and the wrath of his wife but what he wasn't ready for was to see Levana, sitting in a corner of the room in tears.</p><p>"Eva?" Aemond called as he walked towards her in worry but the princess held the dagger out to him. The prince took a step back as the princess slowly began to stand up from the floor, the dagger still pointed at him.</p><p>"Did you know about this, Aemond?" Levana asked, "did you know about this plot to usurp my mother?"</p><p>Aemond shook his head, "Levana, I swear to you on the lives of our children, I played no hand in the plot."</p><p>"And yet you so willingly went to the streets to look for Aegon," Levana responded as tears began to fall from her eyes, "did you also know that our marriage held a political stand?"</p><p>"What?" Aemond looked at her, "my love, please put the dagger down and we can discuss all of this properly."</p><p>
<b>
<em>"Did you ever love me at all, Aemond?"</em>
</b>
</p><p><em>"I love you, Levana," </em>Aemond responded, <em>"everything that I said about my feelings toward you is true and I swear my life on it."</em></p><p><em>"Then why is it so easy for you to forget your promise to me?!" </em>Levana shouted, <em>"you promised me that we would flee King's Landing, Aemond!"</em></p><p>"Levana, we are staying for our children to be protected," Aemond stood his ground, "we cannot guarantee their protection when a war arises if we are not on the side of the crown!"</p><p>"So you would let Aegon take the throne?" Levana asked as Aemond nodded, "you would let Aegon depose me as Queen?"</p><p>"Eva, you will still be crowned Queen if I am ever to take the throne."</p><p>"Aemond, I was born to be <b>the </b>Queen," Levana stated firmly as she finally let her hand fall to her side, "I do not want to be <b>your </b>Queen Consort."</p><p>"Then this is what we shall have to live with," Aemond said, "I am thinking of our family, Eva."</p><p>"My mother will protect us in Dragonstone and if not her, my Grandsire will do so in Driftmark," Levana said,<b> "Aemond, please, if you have any love for me left, you will do this for me."</b></p><p>"It is because of my love for you and our children that I am taking Aegon's side," Aemond explained, "we are to stand with him at his coronation in a few days' time."</p><p>Aemond took a seat on the bed as Levana watched him. The princess wiped the tears from her eyes as she walked toward her husband, kneeling beside him and setting the dagger aside, "I don't want to be here, Aemond."</p><p>"We will think of a plan," Aemond stated, "but for now, please bear it."</p><p>Levana looked at him with a sad expression as she took his hand in hers before nodding her head slowly, "for the children." She would have to bear with her husband's request for now - after all, there's nothing she could do when she's in such a minority.</p><p>Aemond nodded, "for the children," he said as he brought her hand to his lips and kissed her knuckles.</p>

<p>Levana was miserable. She's been locked inside the Red Keep for days and was transferred to her Grandsire's former room with Baelon and Aemma while Aemond stayed in their shared chambers. All this was to prevent Levana from interfering with the preparations for Aegon's coronation.</p><p>King Viserys' crown sat on top of his sculpture of the Valyrian Empire. Levana couldn't stop staring at it. Her grandfather had left her with something that not only made her more confused but it just added to the plethora of reasons why she wanted to leave the Red Keep.</p><p>Ser Nandor disobeyed her orders and returned to the Red Keep to still serve as her personal guard. He did, however, guarantee that Galatea was able to leave King's Landing safely - this is the only fact that relieved Levana throughout the ordeal. At the very least, her closest friend was safe from harm.</p><p>The door to the room opened to reveal Ser Nandor and Ser Erryk. It confused Levana but he welcomed both knights inside, instructing her children to stay by the bed.</p><p>"Ser Erryk will be leaving for Dragonstone," Ser Nandor stated, "he wishes to take you, your children, and Princess Rhaenys with him."</p><p>"You won't be able to leave safely if I am with you, Ser Erryk," Levana stated, "please help my grandmother to leave King's Landing instead."</p><p>"Princess, this is our chance," Ser Nandor said as Levana shook her head, "I'm instructed to appear at the coronation in a few hour's time, we will get caught with the number of guards and the City Watch in King's Landing."</p><p>"Do me this favor, Ser Erryk," Levana smiled, "I pray for your safety when you leave King's Landing."</p><p>"I pray that you may be able to join us, Princess Levana," Ser Erryk responded as he bowed his head. The knight was just about to leave when Levana turned to look at the crown again, she smiled slightly at the idea that came to her.</p><p>"Ser Erryk, please wait a moment," Levana said as she took the crown from the sculpture and walked to the bed to wrap it neatly in one of the blankets that she uses for the children.</p><p>"If you reach Dragonstone, please give this to my mother," Levana requested as the knight nodded and accepted the crown before hiding it in the bag across his chest.</p><p>"Princess Rhaenyra will receive this," Ser Erryk vowed, "this I promise, Princess Levana."</p><p>The female nodded as Ser Erryk left the room. Ser Nandor, on the other hand, stayed behind to guard the princess' door.</p><p>"Do you refuse to leave King's Landing because you find it difficult or do you refuse because of your husband?" Ser Nandor asked, "I know that it isn't my place, Princess Levana, but we are talking about life and death."</p><p>
<b>"The princess knows better than to leave, her life depends on her service to King Aegon."</b>
</p><p>Levana and Ser Nandor turned to see that Lord Larys Strong had found his way into the chambers. From behind him, the knight was able to identify that he came from another secret passageway hidden in the walls.</p><p>"How did you get inside?!" Levana asked as she hurriedly ran towards her children. Princess Aemma and Prince Baelon were crying in confusion as Lord Larys approached the princess, "you would know better than to hide from me, Princess, I might just be able to help you."</p><p>"I need none of your services," Levana hissed.</p><p>"But you do," Lord Larys replied, "especially since I know that you had plans to escape King's Landing."</p><p>The princess looked at her sworn sword before nodding at him.</p><p>"You would do better than fight me, Princess Levana," Lord Larys stated, "I can help you just as I helped the Queen with her problems."</p><p>Levana turned to her children and held them close, "hide beneath the sheets," she whispered to them as they dove beneath the sheets of the bed. Ser Nandor, on the other hand, unsheathed his sword and walked to Levana's side.</p><p>"You are of no use to me, Lord Larys."</p><p>"I doubt," Lord Larys chuckled, "if you didn't need me then I suppose you know what came of Seasmoke? Your father's dragon?"</p><p>Levana's eyes widened, "what happened to Seasmoke?"</p><p>"He was stolen at dawn," Lord Larys stated, "my sources say that the dragon was flying west."</p><p>"That doesn't make me need you," Levana stated, "I would have found out about it either way from the Queen or the Hand."</p><p>"What makes you think that they still trust you, Princess?" Lord Larys asked with a small grin on his face, "remember that you are an opposition to them."</p><p>Levana raised a brow, "are you trying to threaten me?"</p><p>"I'm saying that I got rid of many people for the Queen," Lord Larys boasted, "two of them very close to you."</p><p>Levana raised a brow, "I don't understand?"</p><p>"Oh, forgive me," Lord Larys chuckled, "they weren't close to you per se but to your younger brothers."</p><p>"No," Levana's eyes widened at the realization, "they're your family..."</p><p>"They're yours too, by extension," Lord Larys responded, "Lord Lyonel did see you as a granddaughter."</p><p>"You slayed your own kin!"</p><p>"They were but an obstacle," Lord Larys responded as Levana looked at Ser Nandor who nodded a response.</p><p>"You would be wise to strike a deal with me, Princess Leva--"</p><p>The knight struck the Lord before he could get out another word, causing him to fall to the ground. Lord Larys groaned in pain after being struck across the face by Ser Nandor who chuckled a response, "fucking hell, what a lightweight."</p><p>"Hide him," Levana stated, "make sure no one sees him."</p><p>"The Queen will be looking for him," Ser Nandor stated, "what shall we do then?"</p><p>"Everyone will be too busy in the next few days with Aegon," Levana stated, "no one will think of him."</p><p>The knight nodded and headed toward the same passageway from which Lord Larys came and dragged the Clubfoot out of sight. Levana, on the other hand, closed the passageway and tried to make it look like nothing had happened.</p><p>"Mama?" Aemma called as Levana turned to her daughter who was wiping the tears from her eyes, "I want papa."</p><p>The princess looked at her daughter and wrapped her arms around her, "he'll come soon, I promise."</p><p>As if the gods were listening to them, Prince Aemond walked into the room. Aemma hurriedly ran toward her father, Baelon following shortly after as the prince wrapped his arms around the both of them.</p><p>Levana would not deny that he was an amazing father but because of the circumstances that they were in, doubt toward her husband filled her heart.</p><p>"We are being requested to board the carriages now," Aemond turned to Levana as the nurses came walking into the room. Baelon and Aemma looked at their parents with sad smiles as Aemond made his way out of the room. Levana kissed her children goodbye before following after her husband who waited for her in the hall.</p><p>"I miss you," Aemond confessed as they began to walk toward the courtyard, "nights are not the same without you."</p><p>Levana smiled slightly but chose silence. The prince sighed deeply, "Levana, you know, more than anything, that I am on your side."</p><p>The princess turned to him, "if you were on my side then we would've been in Dragonstone by now."</p><p>"Eva," Aemond sighed, "I don't want to argue with you."</p><p>"Who said that I wanted to argue?" Levana raised a brow.</p><p>"Eva."</p><p>"Aemond."</p><p>There was silence between the two of them before Levana took a deep breath.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Levana began, "our time apart has made me realize how much of an idiot I am for taking my brothers' side after all these years."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Now that I realize it," Levana chuckled, "Lucerys caused our first fight," she sighed, "my brothers may say that they love me but do they really when they insist on hurting the man that I love?"</p><p>Aemond stayed silent as they were escorted into their carriages. Levana attempted to sit away from him but the prince was quick to wrap his arms around her waist, bringing the princess to sit on his lap.</p><p>"Will you ever forgive me for being stupid?" Levana asked, "for having no regard at all for what you felt and taking my brother's side when they never took mine?"</p><p>Aemond leaned his forehead against hers, "Levana, I appreciate the apology but it is not you who should be asking for it."</p><p>"I should be and I am ashamed for what I've done," Levana stated, "I slapped you for calling my brother a bastard when I should've apprehended him when he began laughing at you."</p><p>Aemond placed a kiss on Levana's forehead, "I appreciate it, my love."</p><p>The carriages soon made their way to the Dragonpit where Aegon would be crowned before the smallfolk.</p><p>"If you still want to run away," Aemond whispered, "we shall leave as soon as we can."</p><p>"This isn't some ploy to expose my weakness and then betray me to the Queen, is it?" Levana asked as Aemond looked at his wife in disbelief, "your betrayal is mine as well, do you think I would want that?"</p><p>"I just wanted to make sure, Aemond," Levana sighed, "quite frankly, I no longer know who I can trust."</p><p>"Then trust me," Aemond stated, "we made a vow during our ceremony, remember?"</p><p>Levana raised a brow.</p><p>"Whatever may come, I pledge my loyalty and my honor to you," Aemond recalled as Levana looked at him with a small smile, "you still remember that?"</p><p>"I don't need to remember when I have it in my heart."</p><p>"Do you really mean it?" Levana asked, "we'll escape?"</p><p>Aemond nodded, "I'll make arrangements, I promise."</p><p>Levana smiled. That was all she needed to hear. For the first time in a few days, the princess felt relieved in the arms of her husband.</p><p>For now, at least. </p>

<p>Aemond held Levana in his arms the entire way to the Dragonpit. The two exchanged words of love to each other as the prince assured his wife that they would make sure their children won't be accessories to the war. They went as far as discussing where they would send them on the off chance that they would need to get involved.</p><p>Their children were their first priority - that was without question.</p><p>As they arrived at the Dragonpit, the two waited for their carriage doors to open and they would be escorted to where the coronation was to happen. Aemond fastened his sword to his waist while Levana reached down to pat at her thigh in the guise of fixing her dress but in reality, she was checking if the dagger that her Grandsire left for her was safely in place.</p><p>It didn't take long for Ser Nandor to open the door of their carriage to escort them. The prince held Levana's hand tightly in his as they navigated through the Dragonpit. It was arranged in a way that was similar to what they had at their wedding - only today's event was much grimmer for Levana.</p><p>By standing with her husband, her own mother would consider her to be a traitor.</p><p>Helaena stood just beside her, fiddling with her fingers as Otto stepped up to address the crowd:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>People of King's Landing, today is the saddest of days.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>Our beloved king, Viserys the Peaceful, has died. But it is also the most joyous of days for as his spirit left us, he whispered his final wish that Aegon II, his firstborn son, should succeed him.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Levana watched as the crowd clapped in joy - they would have a King to succeed her Grandsire. Her other hand balled into a fist as the crowd's cheers began to get louder.</p><p>"Today, we also crown a new Queen," Otto added as the now Dowager Queen walked to the center of the stage. She called for Helaena who turned her head toward Levana with a sad smile. The latter could only give her a smile of assurance as she walked toward Dowager Queen Alicent who held in her hands a crown.</p><p>"People of King's Landing," Alicent began, "I present to you, Queen Helaena Targaryen, the Queen Consort," she announced as she placed a crown on Helaena's head. Levana removed her hand from Aemond's grasp to clap - at the very least, there was Helaena that she could be happy for.</p><p>The cheers were interrupted by the marching of the guards who assembled by the crowd. They marched a line from one of the entrances and from where she was standing, Levana could see that some of them were members of the City Watch.</p><p>Trumpets began to play as the knights held their swords in reverence to Aegon who began making his way through the crowd. As Aegon passed them, they let their swords fall to their sides until he reached the stage where they held their swords to their chests.</p><p>Otto began to speak once more:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>It is your great good fortune and privilege to be here to witness this.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>A new day for our city, a new day for our realms, and a new king to lead us.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Aegon looked at Levana with a sad expression as Levana smirked at him. While she did feel bad for him, he accepted the role to participate in her mother's usurpation and that did not sit well with Levana. Though, what irked the princess more was the Hand's speech - addressing the people of the realm that to be in the presence of such a treacherous act was a privilege.</p><p>Gods help them.</p><p>Once Aegon was on the stage, the knights let their swords fall as the Dowager Queen placed a kiss on the prince's forehead. The High Septon then approached them as Aegon knelt down.</p><p>The High Septon took oil in his hands as he began to say:</p><p>May the Warrior give him courage. May the Smith lend strength to his sword and shield.</p><p>The Grand Septon began to anoint Aegon with oil as he continued:</p><p>May the Father defend him in his need. May the Crone lift her shining lamp and light his way to wisdom.</p><p>Levana watched as the High Septon then handed the crown to Ser Criston who now served as the Commander of the Kingsguard - replacing Ser Harold.</p><p>This was when Levana realized that this was an absolute takeover of the kingdom that she believed she would rule.</p><p>The kingdom that she believed loved her Grandsire and her mother.</p><p>"The crown of the Conqueror passed down through generations," Ser Criston held up the crown before placing it on Aegon's head. Levana looked up at her husband who was watching the coronation with a scowl on his face.</p><p>"Love?" Levana whispered as Aemond turned to her. He held her hand again with a sigh, "I'm fine."</p><p>Levana knew that he wasn't but what could they do at the moment?</p><p>Ser Criston took a step back, before addressing the crowd:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>Let the Seven bear witness that Aegon Targaryen is the true heir to the Iron Throne</b>
</p><p> </p><p>There was silence in the crowd for a while as Aegon stood up. He looked at each of his family members who bowed to him. When his eyes landed on Levana, she just gave him a small smile.</p><p>"Levana," the Queen called as Aegon waited for the princess to bow but she stood there. The newly crowned King chuckled in amusement before waving his hand, "you never change."</p><p>"And I never will," Levana responded as Ser Criston cleared his throat before the High Septon addressed the crowd:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>All hail His Grace, Aegon, Seco</b>
<b>nd of His Name, King the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>Aegon the King!</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The crowd began to cheer and clap as Aegon turned to them. With the newfound confidence that the crown bestowed on him, he took out Blackfyre and began to raise it in the air as the crown called for his name.</p><p>"Beware the beast beneath the boards," Levana heard Helaena whisper as she turned to her. Just before she could ask the other princess what she had meant, a loud roar came from below them, and from the ground emerged a dragon.</p><p>The crowd began to scramble in panic as Aemond wrapped his arm around Levana, holding her protectively as his other hand went to the hilt of his sword. Ser Criston ran to them to stand in Helena's defense as the dust disappeared to reveal Princess Rhaenys and Meleys.</p><p>The Hand repeatedly instructed the knights to open the doors as the Queen stood in front of Aegon.</p><p>The Red Queen approached the stage as Princess Rhaenys looked at Levana, her hand outstretched, "come with me!"</p><p>Levana looked at her grandmother and then at Aemond. Before she could respond, Meleyes let out a loud roar as Princess Rhaenys repeated, "Ana, come with me!"</p><p>The princess shook her head as the doors of the Dragonpit began to close. Princess Rhaenys posed a disappointed look on her face but was ultimately met with no choice but to instruct her dragon to leave. Meleys turned her back on them before spreading her wings and flying out of the stronghold.</p><p>"Eva!" The Dowager Queen approached Levana and held her shoulders, "did you know about this?!"</p><p>Levana looked at Alicent in disbelief and shook her head, "I was locked in my room, how could I have helped her?!"</p><p>"Take Princess Levana back to the Red Keep," Otto ordered, "it seems that we have a traitor within our midst."</p><p>"Do not touch my wife!" Aemond took out his sword as the knights started to approach them, "Aegon, do something!"</p><p>"Leave Princess Levana alone," Aegon stated, "there's no way it could've been her."</p><p>"Take them away," the Hand ordered but Aegon stepped in front of the guards, "I am the king now and what I say goes!"</p><p>The knights began to back away from them when Aegon turned to face Aemond and Levana, "you both owe me."</p><p>"Thank you, brother," Aemond muttered as Aegon glared at the Hand, "I want a list of which lords are here and aren't, find your traitor from that list but I will not have you blaming Princess Levana blindly."</p><p>"Thank you, Aegon," Levana whispered as Aemond escorted Levana away from the stage. Ser Nandor met them at the bottom of the stage and at the bottom of the steps to escort them away on their carriage.</p><p>Once they boarded the carriage, Levana let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>At the very least, Levana knew that her grandmother was out of harm's way for now.</p>

<p>The moment that they arrived at the Red Keep, knights approached to separate Levana from Aemond but the latter would not have it. He reminded them that no one was to touch them under King Aegon's orders and whoever shall lay their hands on his family would suffer the wrath of the prince.</p><p>This was able to ward off the knights who tried as much as to get near the prince and princess but it was not able to ward off the Hand of the King and the Queen who personally came to Levana's temporary confinement. Aemond was, in a word, <em>forced </em>to leave his wife behind. Aemond begrudgingly did what he was told and joined their children in the nursery.</p><p>"I don't suppose you know anything about your grandmother's escape, Princess Levana?" Otto asked but Levana refused to speak. She sat on her Grandsire's chair by the fireplace, opposite the Queen while the Hand stood by the door. The male sighed deeply, "it would be much easier if you admitted to anything that you might know."</p><p>"Didn't Aegon instruct that I was not to be accused of my grandmother's escape blindly?" Levana asked as the Dowager Queen sighed.</p><p>"It's not an accusation, Eva," Alicent stated but Levana raised a brow.</p><p>"Examine the Hand's question again, your Grace, he stated that it would be much easier if I admitted to what I might know, did he not?" Levana asked, "is that not an accusation as the Lord Hand already assumed that I had something to do with how Princess Rhaenys escaped?"</p><p>"Princess Levana," Alicent held the princess' hand, "do it for the sake of your children."</p><p>"What will you do to my children?" Levana's eyes shot wide, "are you going to take them from me?"</p><p>"Eva, that's not what I mea--"</p><p>"You'd do to my children the very same thing that my own mother did for me?" Levana asked, "Queen Alicent, for as long as I have resided in the Red Keep, I have stood by your side and that of Aemond's even to the distaste of my kin."</p><p>"Princess Levana," Otto called, "mind your words."</p><p>"Mind my words?" Levana huffed, "mind your own because I will not sit here, be threatened to lose my children, and be accused of an act of treason."</p><p>Alicent reached for Levana's hand and held it tightly, "Eva, know that I trust you; we are just doing this to maintain face."</p><p>"If you trust me, your Grace, then we wouldn't be in this position."</p><p>"Your hostility proves to me that you are guilty of the accusation," Otto stated but the Dowager Queen stood up and faced him, "the princess is hostile because you insist on accusing her of something that she has not done!"</p><p><b>"How can you continue to be so blind, Alicent?" </b>Otto asked, <b>"she's manipulated you."</b></p><p>"Blind?" Alicent hissed, "Levana is your grandson's wife and the mother of your grandchildren, you've treated her as if she was unwelcome in her own home!"</p><p>Just as Otto was about to reply, the doors burst open to reveal Aemond and Ser Nandor. The former immediately rushed to Levana's side and knelt down beside her, holding her hand in his. Meanwhile, Ser Nandor bowed to the royals in front of him, "permission to speak, your Graces?"</p><p>"Please do, Ser Nandor," Alicent stated as Ser Nandor faced the Dowager Queen, "it's been confirmed by Ser Arryk Cargyll that his brother, Ser Erryk, has escaped from King's Landing."</p><p>The Dowager Queen stood up, "he's defected from his duties?"</p><p>"The only other ship that left the port in the hours after King Aegon's coronation was headed for Dragonstone, your Grace," Ser Nandor stated as Alicent nodded and dismissed him. Ser Nandor bowed and left the room, closing the doors behind him as Alicent turned to Otto.</p><p>"You will apologize to Levana," Alicent stated, "you will apologize to the princess for the accusations that you have done."</p><p>Otto glared at the Dowager Queen before turning to face Levana and bowing his head, "my apologies, I may have been wrong about you, Princes Levana."</p><p>"May have been wrong?" Aemond repeated, "you were wrong about her, and yet you still believe that she helped Princess Rhaenys escape though there is enough proof that it wasn't her?"</p><p>"Aemond," the Dowager Queen called, "enough."</p><p><b>"Leave us,</b>" Aemond stated as the Hand nodded at the Dowager Queen who sighed and left the room. The Hand lingered for a few moments, watching Aemond and his wife before taking his leave as well, closing the doors behind him.</p><p>"Now, do you see?" Levana asked, "do you see why I wanted to leave?"</p><p>"I know, Eva," Aemond sighed as he leaned his forehead against his wife's stomach, "I'm sorry, I should have listened."</p><p>"Aemond, I don't know how much more of this I can take," Levana stated, "before you came, your mother hinted that they would involve our children in this and I don't want the both of them to suffer."</p><p>"They'll have to go through me," Aemond said, "I will not let anyone harm you."</p><p>"Aemond, you cannot keep on promising me this," Levana stated as she stood up from her seat, "you cannot keep on promising that we will be safe because we will never be!"</p><p>"Eva!"</p><p>"We will never be safe here, Aemond," Levana began, "not while you are married to me, the daughter of Rhaenyra Targaryen and a threat to Aegon's rule as king."</p><p>Aemond wrapped his arms around her, holding her close to him, "I'm waiting for the right time, Eva, we'll leave when the time is right."</p><p>"The time will never be right, Aemond," Levana sighed, "if a war is to begin and I am sure that it will, we will have no choice but to be a part of it."</p><p>"If your mother concedes and bends the knee, a war will not ensue," Aemond stated as his wife turned to him with disbelief on her face.</p><p>"You want my mother, the rightful heir, to bend the knee to a usurper?" Levana asked, "how dare you?"</p><p>"Eva, that's not what I meant."</p><p>"What else could you have meant, Aemond?"</p><p>"We can avoid war," Aemond sighed, "I can talk to mother and my Grandsire, we can fly to Dragonstone and you can convince her to bend the knee on your own."</p><p>"I will be doing no such thing," Levana smiled, "I would rather die than help this plot."</p><p>"You are being unreasonable," Aemond responded as the princess smiled at him.</p><p>"I'm the unreasonable one now?" Levana chuckled, "you were the one who insisted that we stayed though you promised that we would leave the instant that things went sour."</p><p>"Do you still hold that against me?"</p><p>"I will forever hold that against you because we would've been safer if we had left King's Landing," Levana stated, "until I am released from this room, I <b>will</b> hold it against you." </p>

<p>Princess Rhaenyra walked into the Grand Hall of Dragonstone where she found Lucerys, admiring The Painted Table. She took a deep breath before walking towards him, "there you are."</p><p>"The Sea Snake is going to die, isn't he?" Lucerys asked as his mother looked at him with worry, "Luke--"</p><p>"I can't be Lord of the Tides," Lucerys stated firmly, "Grandsire was the greatest sailor who ever lived and I get greensick before the ship even leaves the harbor!"</p><p>Rhaenyra listened to her son intently, watching him as she placed a hand on her stomach.</p><p>"I don't want Driftmark," Lucerys said, "it should've passed on Jace or even Ser Vaemond!"</p><p>"We do not choose your destiny, Luke," Rhaenyra sighed, "it chooses us."</p><p>"Grandsire let you choose whether you'd be his heir," Lucerys reasoned, "you told us so."</p><p>Rhaenyra placed a hand on the Painted Table before walking toward her son, "and do you want to know the truth of it?"</p><p>"I was frightened," Rhaenyra admitted, "I was four-and-ten, same as you are now, I wasn't ready to be the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms but it was my duty."</p><p>Lucerys looked at his mother with a look that was mixed with confusion and admiration.</p><p>"In time, I came to understand that I had to earn my inheritance," Rhaenyra smiled as Lucerys looked down, "I'm not like you."</p><p>"In what way, sweet boy?"</p><p>"I'm not perfect," Lucerys stated, "I'm not like you and Ana who are perfect to inherit the throne."</p><p>Rhaenya smiled and placed a kiss on her son's temple, holding him close to her, "your sister and I are anything but."</p><p>Lucerys looked down as Rhaenyra continued, "my father looked after me and helped me prepare for my duties as I will with you and Ana."</p><p>"Good morrow, Princess Rhaenyra."</p><p>"Good morrow, Ser Lorent," Rhaenya turned to face the knight who bowed his head in respect.</p><p>"Princess Rhaenys has just arrived on dragonback," Ser Lorent informed, "she urgently requests an audience with you and Prince Daemon."</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Hours after their argument, Levana and Aemond kept their distance from each other.

Levana raised a brow, "as I recall, I was talking to the Lord Hand and not to you."</p><p>"Eva," Dowager Queen Alicent called, "calm down."</p><p>Levana rolled her eyes as Otto read through the paper, his eyes glossing over the terms before she faced the princess.</p><p>"I will sail to Dragonstone as soon as possible," Otto stated, "may I request Princess Levana's presence when I travel?"</p><p>"She's with child," Aemond spoke up, "do you expect her to go on dragonback?"</p><p>

Rhaenys asked, "Levana was there and I do not want to kill my own granddaughter."</p><p>"She is one of them now," Daemon turned to Rhaenyra who winced in pain, "Levana has chosen a side."</p><p>"She stayed so I could escape!"

</p><p> </p><p>"Mother?"</p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys walked into their mother's room and stood beside the Maester Gerardys who called for the princess.</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at his sons as she leaned against one of the pillars, "your Grandsire, King Viserys has passed."</p><p>"Viserys?" Lucerys asked as Jacaerys shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>"The Greens have repudiated the succession and claimed the Iron Throne," Rhaenyra winced as the maester left the room. The princess turned to his sons, "Aegon has been crowned king."</p><p>"What about Ana?" Lucerys asked in a worried tone, "is Ana safe?"</p><p>"For now, she is," Rhaenyra stated, "but I cannot guarantee for sure as the Greens might see her as a traitor."</p><p>"What is to be done about this?" Jacaerys asked as her mother shook her head, "nothing yet."</p><p>"Where is Daemon?"</p><p>"I don't know," Rhaenyra admitted, "gone to madness and gone to plot his war," she continued as she placed her hands on her stomach in an attempt to soothe the pain.</p><p>"Leave Daemon with me."</p><p>Jacaerys looked at Lucerys and signaled for the younger prince to follow him out of the room. Rhaenyra watched his children leave before leaning against the wall in pain.</p><p>"Jace."</p><p>The prince continued walking out of the room.</p><p>"Jacaerys!"</p><p>The older prince stopped by the entrance and turned to his mother with a sad look in his eyes.</p><p>"We cannot guarantee your sister's loyalty to us for now," Rhaenyra sighed, "you will be the heir of whatever claim remains to me should your sister defect."</p><p>"But mother--"</p><p>"Naught is to be done but my command."</p><p>Jacaerys could only nod in agreement before finally leaving the room.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Aemond was unsure at this point if his own wife still had trust in him. He knew, more than anything, that it would've taken brute force for his wife to even volunteer to be in the same room as Aegon's small council which left him wondering why she was so willing to even escort his Grandsire to Dragonstone.</p><p>Was she planning to defect right there?</p><p>He knew that she wouldn't because their children would still be in the Red Keep - unless she ordered someone to help them escape. Though, he did think this to be unlikely.</p><p>Aemond arrived at the Dragonpit just a few hours after their meeting to find his wife just beside her dragon. It's been months since he'd last seen her fly and he knows just how much she missed the feeling of it.</p><p>Vermithor must have sensed the tension between them as he growled when Aemond approached them. The dragon was just as angry to see him as his rider who glared at the approaching prince.</p><p>"You don't have to do this, Eva."</p><p>"I want to do it," Levana responded, "it'll take the attention from me for a while if I do this."</p><p>"How about our plan to leave?" Aemond asked, "are we no longer following that plot?"</p><p>Levana chuckled mockingly, "now you want to discuss leaving with me?" The princess raised a brow. "Don't you think it's a bit too late for that now when we've had so many missed opportunities because of you?"</p><p>"I stalled so the children could be kept safe!"</p><p>"Your stalling is going to be the reason why they're going to be in harm's way!" Levana spat, "admit it, Aemond, you are a part of the plot to usurp my mother from the throne."</p><p>"So what if I am, hm?" Aemond asked, "will that make a difference?"</p><p>"No, but at least I know whose side you're on now," Levana responded as the keepers approached to install Vermithor's saddle on him. The princess approached her husband with disdain in her eyes, "I know now that I can't trust you."</p><p>"I'm your husband, Levana."</p><p>"And I am your wife, Aemond," Levana responded, "you've broken whatever trust I had left and now I am inclined to believe that I am not safe in the Red Keep."</p><p>"Why are you helping Aegon?" Aemond asked, "why are you helping the so-called usurper?"</p><p>"Because I am using whatever leverage that I have right now to my benefit," Levana admitted, "as long as I stay in their good graces, I can buy time to think of an escape plan for myself and the children."</p><p>"I take it, I'm no longer part of the said escape plan."</p><p>Levana furrowed her brows, "you're the reason why I'm at my wit's end right now, Aemond."</p><p>"I did what I had to so I could protect you and the children."</p><p>"No," Levana stated, "we're the same at this point, Aemond, we're doing what we can to stay in their good graces but our goals are very different."</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>"My goal is to escape from here and avoid this war while your goal is to stay in Aegon's small council," Levana crossed her arms, "am I wrong?"</p><p>"Partially," Aemond stated, "if you could escape, where would you go?"</p><p>Levana laughed, "do you really think that I'd tell you?"</p><p>"I hoped you would so I could follow you," Aemond stated, "I'm on your side, Eva."</p><p>
<b>"If I asked you to take the children right now and deliver them to Dragonstone, would you go?"</b>
</p><p>Aemond was taken aback. He hesitated to answer which earned a chuckle from Levana.</p><p>"Exactly, Aemond," Levana sighed, "exactly."</p><p>
<em>"Why are you really helping them, Eva?"</em>
</p><p>Levana looked up at her husband before shaking her head, <em>"I already told you the reason, I'm stalling as much as I can until I think of an appropriate escape."</em></p><p>
<em>"No, what's the real reason?"</em>
</p><p>Levana took a deep breath, <em>"our children are being held as hostages by the Hand, Aemond," </em>she explained, <em>"if I am to not think about my actions properly, we might lose them."</em></p><p><em>"I'll talk to mother," </em>Aemond stated, <em>"she will vouch for us."</em></p><p><em>"This was her idea," </em>Levana sighed, <em>"we are both mothers and we love our children, she knows that I would do everything to protect Aemma and Baelon."</em></p><p>One of the other knights of the Kingsguard approached the two just as Vermithor was finished with his preparations. He informed the princess that the Hand had just boarded the boat and began to set sail. Levana gave him a nod before adjusting her riding gear, a red and black suit that was embellished with gold - a typical color scheme for the princess. Though, what stood out the most to Aemond was the sigil of House Velaryon that was placed as the centerpiece of the top.</p><p>"Where did you get that?" Aemond asked, "I've never seen you use it before."</p><p>"It's a gift from Princess Rhaenys," Levana stated, "I never used it because she had just given this to me before Aegon's coronation."</p><p>"This is the first time that I'm seeing the Velaryon crest in a color other than the very familiar sea green," Aemond raised a brow as Levana mounted her dragon, "is there a reason why?"</p><p>The princess sighed, "Aemond, if color is going to be your basis for my treason, think again because I always wear this color," she stated as Vermithor began to walk out of the Dragonpit. The princess made final adjustments to her saddle and her gloves before patting her dragon's neck. The Bronze Fury responded with a low rumble before spreading its wings and preparing for flight.</p><p><em>"I'm already a traitor to the crown, Aemond," </em>Levana sighed, <em>"above and beyond all this, they have branded me as a traitor and nothing will change that."</em></p><p>"Levana," Aemond called as the princess turned to him, "be safe."</p><p>The princess shook her head and chuckled in amusement before looking at the skies, <em>"fly, Vermithor," </em>she commanded as the dragon took a few steps before finally ascending into the air. </p>

<p>Rhaenyra didn't expect to lose the throne and her daughter so close to each other. Her heart broke as she watched her daughter's body burn on the pyre. </p><p>She would've been called Visenya — after Rhaenyra's idol. </p><p>This, of course, was also hard on her sons. Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey, had to suffer the loss of two sisters — they believed that Levana would take the Greens' side soon enough. </p><p>They had lost her too. </p><p>Among the three, Jacaerys is the only one who believes otherwise. He knew that their sister wouldn't do such a thing. The young prince knew that there must be a reason why his sister stayed in King's Landing. </p><p>Jacaerys' musing was interrupted when he saw a knight approaching his mother and step-father.</p><p>"I  mean no harm, brothers." </p><p>Daemon turned away from his daughter's pyre to face the approaching knight who took off his halfhelm. Ser Erryk knelt in front of Daemon before taking a crown from his pouch. Rhaenyra turned to the knight in shock - the sight of her father's crown was enough to make even those in attendance look in wonder.</p><p>“Where did you get this?” Daemon asked as Ser Erryk looked up at him, “Princess Levana willed for her mother to have the crown, my Prince.” </p><p>“Ana?” Rhaenyra’s eyes widened, “is my daughter alright? Is she safe?” </p><p>“She’s well, princess,” Ser Erryk stated, “but Prince Baelon and Princess Aemma have been held hostage by the Queen and the Hand.” </p><p>“What is your business here, Ser Erryk?” Daemon asked as the knight presented the crown to Princess Rhaenyra with the words: <br/><br/></p><p align="center">
<b>I swear to ward the Queen with all my strength and give my blood for hers. </b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall guard her secrets, obey her commands, ride at her side, and defend her name. </b>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Daemon took the crown in his hands before turning to his wife. Ser Erryk looked at his Queen, "and her honor," he said in finality as the prince approached Rhaenyra.</p><p>The prince looked at his wife before placing the crown on his wife’s head. Daemon bent the knee to his wife before looking up at her, "my Queen." </p><p>Daemon bowed as Rhaenyra looked upon those who gathered at her daughter's funeral. One by one, they all bent the knee to her - the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. </p><p>Princess Rhaenys looked upon them with a small smile before nodding at Rhaenyra who took a deep breath.</p><p>She was Queen now. </p><p>When they returned to the castle, they wasted no time in preparing for the storm that was to come. The Painted Table was illuminated with fire as the Lords and Ladies gathered in the Great Hall where Daemon waited for the Queen to arrive. </p><p>Rhaenyra walked into the room with an entourage of knights as Daemon began, "Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lady of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm." </p><p>Those present in the Great Hall bowed their heads to honor the Queen as Daemon looked at her with a small nod, "Your Grace." </p><p>The Black Queen began to advance towards the table, stopping slightly to gesture for the knights to stop following her. As she continued toward the table, Rhaena approached her with a chalice, "wine, my Queen," she said as Rhaenyra smiled and accepted the cup. She gestured for her stepdaughter to join her, stopping slightly by Baela so she could gesture for her to join them as well. </p><p>Once they were all gathered at the table, the Queen looked up at her husband, "what's our standing?" </p><p>"We have 30 knights, a hundred crossbow men, and 300 men-at-arms," Daemon began, "Dragonstone is relatively easy to defend but as it is an instrument of conquest, our army leaves a lot to be desired." </p><p>Rhaenyra listened intently, her eyes glancing at the table and then back at Daemon from time to time. </p><p>"We have sent word to my loyal men in the City Watch," the Rogue Prince continued, "we'll have some support there but I cannot speak the numbers." </p><p>"We already have declarations from Celtigar and Staunton, Massey, Darklyn, and Bar Emmon," Maester Gerardys stated before Rhaenyra gestured towards the Painted Table, "my Lady Mother was an Arryn, the Vale will not turn cloak against their own kin." </p><p>Jacaerys placed the pieces on the board, just above the area of the Vale.</p><p>"Riverrun was always a close friend to your father, your Grace," the maester brought up, "with Prince Daemon's acquiescence, I've already sent ravens to Lord Grover."</p><p>Another piece was added to the board. </p><p>"Lord Grover is fickle and easily swayed," Rhaenyra sighed, "he will need to be convinced of the strength of our position and that we will support him when it comes to a war." </p><p>"I will treat with him myself," Daemon volunteered. </p><p>"What of Storm's End and Winterfell?" </p><p>"There has never lived a Stark who forgot an oath and with House Stark, the North will follow."</p><p>"Lord Borros Baratheon will need to be reminded of his father's promises," Rhaenyra stated, this added another piece to the table. </p><p>The Queen then turned to Princess Rhaenys, "what news from Driftmark?" </p><p>Rhaenys looked at the Queen, "Lord Corlys sails for Dragonstone." </p><p>"To declare for his Queen," Daemon interrupted, earning a small glare from the princess. </p><p>"The Velaryon Fleet is under my husband's yoke," Rhaenys reminded, "he decides where they sail." </p><p>"We shall pray for both you and your husband's support," the Queen nodded, "just as we prayed for the Sea Snake's return to good health." </p><p>Princess Rhaenys bowed her head in acknowledgement. </p><p>"There's no port on the Narrow Sea that would dare to make an enemy of the Velaryon Fleet," Rhaenyra stated before turning back to her Council, "and our enemies?" </p><p>"We've no friends among the Lannisters," Daemon started, "Tyland has served the Hand too long to go against him and Otto Hightower needs the Lannister Fleet." </p><p>Jacaerys circles around the Painted Table, adding pieces as the discussion continues.</p><p>"Without the Lannisters, we are not like to find any allies west of the Golden Tooth," Rhaenyra clarified as Daemon shook his head, "no." </p><p>"The Riverlands are essential, Your Grace," Daemon reminded.</p><p>"Pray forgive my bluntness, Your Grace, but talk of men is moot when your cause owns a power that has not been seen in this world since the days of Old Valyria." </p><p>Rhaenyra and Daemon exchanged looks.</p><p>"Dragons."</p><p>"The Greens have dragons as well," Rhaenyra began but Daemon cut her statement with his own, "they have four adults by my count." </p><p>The Queen listened on.</p><p>"We have Syrax, Ceraxes, and Meleys," Daemon continued, "your sons have Vermax, Arrax, and Tyraxes," he turned toward his daughter, "Baela has Moondancer."</p><p>"Daemon, none of our dragons have been to war."</p><p>"There are also unclaimed dragons," Daemon said, "Silverwing dwells on the Dragonmont and the three wild dragons that all nest here." </p><p>"And who is to ride them?" </p><p>"Dragonstone has 13 more to their own," Daemon responded, "I also have a score of eggs incubating in the Dragonmont." </p><p>Ser Erryk excused himself from the table as a squire entered the room. Daemon continued on with his plotting, "now, we need a place to gather, a toehold that's large enough to house a sizable host." </p><p>The Rogue Prince began to place pieces of his own on the Painted Table, "here at Harrenhal," he placed a few more, "we cut off the West and surround King's Landing with the dragons and we can have all the Greens' heads mounted on spikes before the fucking moon turns." </p><p>"Your Grace," Lucerys spoke, "what about Ana, Baelon, and Aemma?" </p><p>"She's a bloody traitor and her head will join her husband's," Daemon responded, earning a shocked expression from his wife, "you do not speak about my daughter in that manner until it's been proven." </p><p>"What more proof do we need?" </p><p>"Ser Erryk told us that the children are being held hostage," Rhaenyra stated, "and Levana is still of my blood and I refuse to have you call her a traitor and threaten her with death until I have the truth of it." </p><p>Daemon took a stepback as Ser Erryk approached them, "Your Grace, a ship has been spotted offshore, a lone galleon that flies a banner of three-headed green dragon." </p><p>"Alert watchtowers and sight the skies," Daemon commanded as he grabbed his sword. The prince, the Queensguard, and a few knights made their way to the bridge where they were met by Otto Hightower and his own entourage.</p><p>"I come at the behest of the Dowager Queen Alicent, mother of King Aegon, the Second of His Name, Lord and Protector of the Seven Kingdoms." </p><p>Daemon listened impatiently as Otto continued to speak, "I've been directed to deliver her message only to Princess Rhaenyra." </p><p>A loud roar echoed through the skies as Syrax appeared in the sky, flying toward the group before landing just behind her entourage. She unmounted from Syrax before joining her husband's side. Otto could only chuckle in amusement, "Princess Rhaenyra." </p><p>"I'm Queen Rhaenyra now," The Black Queen stated, "and you all are traitors to the realm." </p><p>"King Aegon Targaryen, in his wisdom and desire for peace, is offering terms," Otto began, "acknowledge him as King and swear obeisance to the Iron Throne." </p><p>Rhaenyra rolled her eyes ever so slightly. </p><p>"In exchange, His Grace will confirm your possession of Dragonstone, and it will pass onto Prince Jacaerys — at the terms set by Princess Levana — upon your death, Lucerys will be confirmed as the legitimate heir to Driftmark and all the Lands and Holdings of House Velaryon." </p><p>Otto could tell the the Black Queen was growing tired of his speeches, "Princess Levana will be confirmed as Prince Aemond's Queen Consort should he inherit the Iron Throne and she will be given a place in the King's council while your sons by Prince Daemon will be given places of high honor at court: Aegon the Younger as his squire and Viserys as his cupbearer." </p><p>Daemon felt his blood boil. </p><p>"Finally, the King, in his good grace, will pardon any knight or Lord who conspired against his ascent." </p><p>"I would rather feed my sons to the dragons than have them carry shields and cups for your drunken, usurper, cunt of a king." </p><p>Rhaenyra watched the exchange between her husband and Otto with a serious expression — in her head, it was impossible for Aegon to offer those terms to them. He wouldn't be swayed that way. </p><p>"Aegon Targaryen sits the Iron Throne," Otto stated, "he wears the Conqueror's crown, wields the Conqueror's sword, has the Conqueror's name and he was anointed by a septon of the Faith in the eyes of thousands." </p><p>Daemon glared as Otto continued with his speech. The time that they've spent talking to him could've been spent in further planning their advances. To the prince, Otto was a waste of time.</p><p>"Every symbol of legitimacy belongs to him,' Otto continued, "then there is Stark, Tully, Baratheon — Houses that have also received and are, at present, considering generous terms from the King."</p><p>"Stark, Tully, and Baratheon, all swore to me when King Viserys named me his heir," Rhaenyra reminded.</p><p>"Stale oaths will not put you on the Iron Throne, princess," Otto chuckled as he advanced towards her, "the succession changed the day that your father sired a son and it is my deepest regret that you both were the last to see the truth of it." </p><p>Rhaenyra, enraged by what the Hand claims, approached him and took off the symbol of his title before throwing it into the ocean, "you are no more Hand than Aegon is King, you fucking traitor." </p><p>The tension between both parties grew as their respective entourages began to draw swords. </p><p>"Grand Maester," Otto called as the Maester approached him, handing the Hand a folded piece of paper from his satchel. </p><p>"What the fuck is this?" Daemon hissed as Otto handed the paper to Rhaenyra. The Queen unfolded the piece and was shocked to see that it had been the same page that she once tore and gave to Alicent when they were much younger. </p><p>"The Dowager Queen has not forgotten the love you once had for each other," Otto sighed, "no blood need be spilled, so the realm can carry on in peace." </p><p>Rhaenyra was silent as she observed the paper as Otto watched her, "Queen Alicent eagerly awaits your answer." </p><p>"She can have her answer now, stuffed in her father's mouth along with her father's cock," Daemon bellowed, "let's end this mummer's farce," he unsheathed Dark Sister before pointing it toward the Hand. </p><p>"Ser Erryk, bring me Lord Hightower so I may take the pleasure myself." </p><p>At the comment, a much louder road echoed through the skies. Rhaenyra's eyes shot wide at the realization of who the sound must've come from. Sure enough, Vermithor appeared from the clouds and landed just behind Otto's entourage. </p><p>The Black Queen looked toward the rider whose armor bore the Velaryon sigil. Levana looked at her mother and bowed her head slightly. </p><p>"Ana." </p><p>"Mother." </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Levana looked down at the entourage that Otto had assembled and then at her mother who stood beside her stepfather.</p><p>"How nice of you to finally join us, Princess Levana," Otto stated as Levana unmounted from her dragon. Vermithor stood in attention at the presence of the other dragon that sneered at its arrival.</p><p><em>"Is it true?" </em>Rhaenyra asked, <em>"are my grandchildren being held hostage by the Dowager Queen so you would do their bidding?"</em></p><p>Levana nodded, <em>"as much as I want to do something about it, I have to be careful for the sake of my children."</em></p><p><em>"And your husband?" </em>Daemon asked, <em>"where does he stand in all of this?"</em></p><p><em>"My husband has told me numerous times that he would stand beside me," </em>Levana sighed, <em>"though I have my doubts now."</em></p><p><em>"Do you still have allies in the Red Keep?" </em>Rhaenyra asked, <em>"you need not tell me who they are, just tell me if you have any left."</em></p><p><em>"I have one," </em>Levana stated, <em>"I told my trusted handmaiden to leave before things got ugly."</em></p><p><em>"That's very kind of you, Ana," </em>Rhaenyra sighed, <em>"but you have put yourself at such a disadvantage."</em></p><p><em>"I will send for my men from the City Watch to help you," </em>Daemon stated, <em>"at the very least, they would be able to help you escape from the King's Landing."</em></p><p>"You do realize that conversing in your mother tongue in my presence is an act of treason?" Otto asked, "you'd do well to remember that."</p><p>Levana glared, "if I wanted you dead, Lord Hightower, you would know by now."</p><p>"Do not threaten me," Otto responded, "you do know have your children by the neck."</p><p>"Involving children, Otto?" Rhaenyra raised a brow, "that's inhumane, even for you."</p><p>"Princess Levana has been inducted to the King's Small Council," Otto announced, "the measures that we take simply are simply to ensure her loyalty to the Iron Throne."</p><p>Levana sighed, placing a hand on the dagger on her belt. Rhaenyra noticed this and gasped slightly - the dagger was very familiar to her.</p><p><em>"Where did you get that dagger?" </em>Rhaenyra asked as Levana lifted her hand from the hilt, <em>"it was from my grandsire, King Viserys."</em></p><p>
<em>"Why do you have it?"</em>
</p><p><em>"He gave it to me," </em>Levana stated, <em>"he gave it to me on his deathbed."</em></p><p>"I've had enough of this," Otto interjected, "your response, Princess Rhaenyra?"</p><p>"King's Landing will have my answer on the morrow," Rhaenyra responded as she turned her back and began to make her way back into the palace.</p><p>Syrax flew just after her master left. Vermithor saw her off with a loud grumble before flying off. Levana knew that she would be getting a mouthful once she arrived back at the Red Keep - the Hand won't give her much peace after her conversation with her mother.</p><p>Levana and her dragon landed safely at the Dragonpit. As soon as she unmounted from Vermithor, the dragon made its way back into the pit and into its chambers - one that was constructed for him at the order of her grandsire.</p><p>The princess looked at her dragon as it left before turning to make her way back to her horse that waited for her arrival.</p><p>"How was it?"</p><p>Levana bore a look of shock at the sight of her husband, leaning against a carriage. She thought that he had already retreated to the palace after she flew off but as it turns out, he might have waited for her to return.</p><p>"Exhausting," Levana admitted, "I had half the mind to burn your grandsire and his entourage right then and there but I kept my ambitions to myself as I didn't want to bring harm to my children."</p><p>Aemond chuckled as he pushed himself away from the carriage to stand by the door, "speaking of our children," he said as he pulled the door open. Immediately, Aemma and Baelon ran out of the carriage and into their mother's arms. Levana smiled, embracing her children, it had been a while since she saw them last.</p><p>"How are my two little dragons?" Levana asked, "has your grandmother been treating you well?"</p><p>Aemma nodded, "we also get to play with our cousins!"</p><p>"Aunt Helaena plays with us too!" Baelon excitedly said as Levana listened to the eager stories from her children. Aemond watched as his wife's expression softened - a contrast to how hard she had looked in the past few days.</p><p>"Shall we head back to the Red Keep?" Aemond asked, "the four of us can spend time together in the Godswood, reading stories," he added, earning a smile from Levana. It had been a while since they were able to be in each other's company.</p><p>"I would like that very much," Levana smiled as she carried Baelon in her arms while Aemond took Aemma in hers.</p><p>The four would return to the Red Keep while the Hand and his entourage were still on their voyage. They would need to spend as much time together for the time that they had lost and possibly, for the time that they had left.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Princess Rhaenys retreated to her husband's chambers after they were dismissed by the Black Queen from the Great Hall. She had spent many hours watching over him - so much so that she had fallen asleep on the chair beside his bed.</p><p>"I've had men whipped for falling asleep on their watch."</p><p>Princess Rhaenys was jolted awake by the sound of her husband's voice. She turned her head to face as the Sea Snake sighed.</p><p>"But you are no man."</p><p>"You abandoned me when I most needed you," Rhaenys began, "both our children were stolen from us and I needed you."</p><p>Lord Corlys turned his head but his Lady Wife would continue with her sentiments.</p><p>"Baela and Rhaena needed you but you abandoned us for more adventure at sea," Princess Rhaenys sighed as she reached for the cloth in a bowl of water, "as has always been your way."</p><p>"I had no other place to turn," Lord Corlys confessed, "I lost everything."</p><p><b>"We lost, Corlys,"</b> Rhaenys interjected,<b> "we," </b>she repeated before taking a seat by his bedside to run the wet cloth by his hands.</p><p>"I understand we have a new king," Lord Corlys sighed.</p><p>"The Stranger casts a long shadow over this family," Rhaenys sighed as she placed the cloth on her husband's forehead, "your brother is also dead."</p><p>Lord Corlys tried to sit up abruptly upon hearing the news but his wife kept a hand on his chest to keep him from exhausting his body more.</p><p>"In his haste to bury you and claim your seat, he stood before the King and denounced Laenor's sons as illegitimate," Rhaenys narrated, "Daemon took his head for it."</p><p>The Sea Snake huffed, "heedless ambition has always been a Velaryon weakness," he admitted before turning back to face the princess, "you were right, Rhaenys, I reached too far and for nothing."</p><p>The princess listened on as her husband took her hand in his, "our pursuit of the Iron Throne is at an end and we shall declare for no one."</p><p>Princess Rhaenys shook her head.</p><p>"We shall retire to High Tide to be content with our grandchildren and--"</p><p>"Ana, Jace, Luke, and Joff, are claimants to the throne," Rhaenys reminded, "they will not be safe so long as Aegon is king."</p><p>"Where is Ana?" Lord Corlys asked, "is our granddaughter in Dragonstone?"</p><p>Rhaeys shook her head, "she stayed in the Red Keep so I could escape."</p><p>Lord Corlys glared, "Rhaenyra has gone too far with allowing Levana to stay in the Red Keep and she was complicit in our son's death."</p><p>Princess Rhaenys took a deep breath as Lord Corlys gritted his teeth, "that girl ruins everything she touches."</p><p>"Coryls, that girl is holding the realm together at present."</p><p>The Sea Snake looked at his wife with a curious expression as Princess Rhaenys continued, "every man standing at the Painted Table urges her to plunge the realm into war and she's the only one who has demonstrated restraint."</p><p>"What would you have me do, Rhaenys?"</p><p>The princess sighed, "the right thing, Corlys." </p>

<p>The day after the encounter at Dragonstone was hectic, to say the least.</p><p>The princess was removed from her husband and children's presence to be locked up in her grandsire's room. Otto described it as a "punishment" for planning treason with her mother.</p><p>Aemond was, of course, angry - very angry to the point that he took his complaints directly to his brother, the king. Aegon had his doubts, of course, but he decided to hear the story from Levana herself. This led to their meeting which wasn't as productive as Aegon thought.</p><p>The moment Levana took her seat at the table, she was bombarded by accusations from the Hand and the members of the small council - particularly Tyland Lannister who seemed to fully agree with what Otto was saying.</p><p>Queen Alicent placed her hands on her forehead before slamming her hands on the table, <b>"leave Princess Levana alone!"</b></p><p>Dowager Queen Alicent's raised voice was enough to bring the entire room to silence as Aemond walked beside his wife's chair, placing a hand on her shoulder as Aegon looked at them, "just tell us what you were talking about with your mother, sister," he sighed, "get this over with."</p><p>"I told you," Levana responded, "it's a matter that doesn't concern any of you."</p><p>"Were you plotting against the King, Princess?" Tyland raised a brow, "for what reason can you not tell us what you and your mother conversed about in High Valyrian in front of the Hand?"</p><p>Levana placed a hand on her stomach, "we were talking about my pregnancy," she lied, "as you all might remember, I am with child."</p><p>"For what reason do we have to believe you?" Tyland raised a brow.</p><p>Levana looked at him and then at Aegon, "Your Grace, is this the type of company that you would want in your small council?"</p><p>"You forget yourself, Lord Tyland," Aegon leaned against his seat, "do remember that Princess Levana is of House Targaryen and she is to be treated with respect despite the unproven claims that the Hand and Cole make of her."</p><p>"Her mother threatens to take the throne," Tyland continued, "and yet she is present at your Small Council."</p><p>"She is my sister by marriage and my niece, mind you," Aegon responded, "she is well-versed in matters that concern the realm and she is a dragonrider, you are a Lannister with a Fleet that can be taken down by Vermithor's flames."</p><p>Tyland looked at his lap in silence.</p><p>"Know your place, Lord Tyland," Aegon stated, "that goes for you all."</p><p>"Aegon, stop it," Alicent sighed as the King turned to her.</p><p>"The next person that tries to question Princess Levana and her loyalty to the throne over baseless claims will answer to myself and the Conqueror's sword," Aegon hissed, "do you understand?"</p><p>Those present at the King's Small Council could only nod. Aegon wasn't normally this serious but as he has grown to be fond of Levana - it was only expected that he would be taking her side.</p><p>"No more questions of Princess Levana's loyalty," Aegon repeated, "her family and that of my brother will be under my protection and if they are so much as threatened, I will have somebody's head on a spike for it."</p><p>The Hand cleared his throat, "there is a matter of our allies to be discussed, your Grace," he began to avoid the topic, "we need to secure our allies as most of the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms swore fealty to Princess Rhaenyra when she was named heir."</p><p>"We have House Strong," Alicent stated, "I shall have a word with Lord Larys when I see him next."</p><p>For a moment, Levana felt her heart drop - she clutched the fabric of her dress before looking over at Ser Nandor who gave her a nod of assurance. The princess smiled before looking up at her husband who listened intently to the conversation.</p><p>"House Baratheon might need more convincing," the Hand stated as he turned to Aemond, "Prince Aemond, fly to Storm's End to secure the support of Lord Borros Baratheon."</p><p>Aemond nodded but as he was about to leave, he was stopped by the Dowager Queen who turned to Levana, "the princess will join you."</p><p>"She's with child!" Aemond responded, "I will not risk it."</p><p>"Princess Levana is a Baratheon by her grandmother, Princess Rhaenys," Alicent stated, "it would only be appropriate that she would be the one to treat with her granduncle."</p><p>"I will refuse on my wife's behalf," Aemond stated, "she's already been on dragonback and even the short journey to Dragonstone proved to exert much effort for her."</p><p>"You will be with her," Otto reasoned, "you can keep an eye on her."</p><p>"You forget that her pregnancy is at risk as it is," Aemond reasoned, "remember that she already bled in the past and I will not put my wife and child at risk."</p><p>"Let it go, Aemond," Levana sighed as she stood up from her seat, the prince placed a hand around her waist to help her maintain balance, "let's just get this over with."</p><p>The two left the room with Ser Nandor in tow. The knight kept his distance from the both of them, allowing Aemond to whisper words of assurance to his wife.</p><p>"It will be a quick trip, I promise," Aemond assured.</p><p>"It's not the length of the trip that I am worried about, Aemond," Levana sighed, "it's the fact that my mother will also surely send an envoy to Storm's End and it might be one of my brothers."</p><p>"I vow to behave."</p><p>"I hardly doubt it."</p><p>"Eva," Aemond sighed, "please trust me."</p><p>"Aemond, my love," Levana looked up at him, "I do but as you know, things have not been the same since Aegon's coronation and my heart trusts you, my husband, but I cannot bring my mind to do the same."</p><p>Aemond would be lying if he said that his wife's words cut through him like a knife. It was one thing that they were trying to fix whatever rift they had but to have confirmation from her that she no longer fully trusted in him was another. It felt as though a sword had been driven through his chest - though, his wife's lack of trust in him proved to hurt much more than the wound from a sword.</p><p>"We'll leave the message at Storm's End and leave immediately after the formalities," Aemond sighed, "I will not question it and if we were to encounter any of your brothers, I would leave it at that."</p><p>"Do you swear it?" Levana asked as Aemond smiled slightly, placing his hands on either side of Levana's stomach. He knelt in front of her, placing a kiss on her stomach. He leaned his forehead on her stomach and sighed, "I swear it."</p><p>"You better make good on your promise," Levana sighed, "at least, this one."</p><p>Aemond looked up at his wife and nodded sadly. He knew he had disappointed her too much now.</p><p>"Your Graces," Ser Nandor approached them with a scroll, "the message for you to deliver to Storm's End has arrived."</p><p>The prince took a scroll in his hand before standing up straight. He held Levana's hand in his and placed a kiss on her knuckles.</p><p>"Let's be off, my love."</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Rhaenyra sat by her Painted Table, there was so much on her mind that she didn't bother listening to the conversations of the lords who stood by her. Her mind was clouded with many questions but the most important one was why her father gave Levana Aegon the Conqueror's dagger when he had named her heir.</p><p>Does that mean that she was now the true heir to the Iron Throne and not her?</p><p>Has she been deposed by her daughter?</p><p>"The Lord of the Tides, Lord Corlys Velaryon, and his wife, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen."</p><p>Rhaenyra immediately stood up from her seat and stood in attention to welcome the Lord who walked slowly down the steps with his wife and grandchildren.</p><p>"My lords," Corlys acknowledged the others as Rhaenys stood by his side. Baela and Rhaena would proceed to stand by their betrothed on the other end of the table.</p><p>"Lord Corlys," Rhaenyra greeted, "it brings much relief to see you here and healthy again."</p><p>Lord Corlys nodded, "I'm very sorry about your father, princess," he bowed his head slightly, "he was a good man."</p><p>At that, the Lord of the Tides directed his attention to the others present in the room, "where is Daemon?"</p><p>"There are other concerns that demanded the prince's attention," Rhaenyra responded as Lord Corlys hummed in acknowledgment before glancing over the Painted Table, "your declared allies?"</p><p>"Yes--"</p><p>"Too few to win a war for the throne."</p><p>Rhaenyra was taken aback, "well, we would also hope to have the support of Houses Arryn, Baratheon, and Stark."</p><p>"Hope is the fool's ally," Lord Corlys stated.</p><p>"Both Arryn and Baratheon share a blood with my House," Rhaenyra pointed out, "but all of them swore oaths to me."</p><p>"As did House Hightower."</p><p>"As did you, Lord Corlys."</p><p>Lord Corlys turned to his wife, "Houses Baratheon and Arryn also share a blood with someone who is still in King's Landing," he responded, "Levana still stands as their only way to secure the support of those Houses."</p><p>"I acknowledge that," Rhaenyra stated, "we are presently thinking of a way to help my daughter escape from King's Landing."</p><p>"It is my very hope that my granddaughter is retrieved," Corlys stated as Rhaenyra nodded, "she is our priority."</p><p>The Lord of the Tides nodded before glancing at the Painted Table once more, "your father's realm was one of justice and honor," he began, "our Houses are bound by common blood and common cause."</p><p>Lord Corlys then turned toward the other lords, "this Hightower treason cannot stand," he stated, "you have the full support of our fleet and House, your Grace," he said before bowing his head to his Queen.</p><p>"You honor me, Lord Corlys," Rhaenyra stated before turning her head to face the other princess, "Princess Rhaenys."</p><p>The Black Queen took a deep breath, "but, as I said to my bannermen, I made a promise to my father to hold the realm strong and united," she said firmly, "if war's first stroke is to fall, it will not be by my hand."</p><p>"You do not mean to act?" Lord Corlys asked with a confused expression.</p><p>"Taking caution does not mean standing fast," Rhaenyra explained, "I wish to know who my allies are before I send them to war."</p><p>Lord Corlys approached the Queen, "the consequence of my near demise at the Stepstones is that we now control them," he said proudly, "I took care to fully garrison the territory this time and a total blockade of the shipping lanes will be in place in days, if not already," he continued.</p><p>Rhaenyra listened intently to what the Lord of the Tides has accomplished. In her mind, this was a strong lead to counter their enemies.</p><p>"The Triarchy have been routed and the Narrow Sea is ours," Lord Corlys stated, "if we further seal the Gullet, we can cut off all seaborn travel and trade to King's Landing."</p><p>"I shall take Meleys and patrol the Gullet myself," Princess Rhaenys said with a small smile.</p><p>"When we drain the Narrow Sea, we can surround King's Landing, lay siege to the Red Keep, and force the Greens' surrender," Lord Bartimos Celtigar stated as Rhaenyra looked down at the Painted Table, thinking about what she would tell her council next.</p><p>"If we are to have enough swords to surround King's Landing, we must first secure the support of Winterfell, the Eyrie, and Storm's End," Rhaenyra stated, placing her hands on the Painted Table as she further observed the map.</p><p>"I'll prepare the ravens, your Grace," Maester Gerardys stated as the Queen nodded.</p><p>"We should bear those messages."</p><p>Almost too quickly, Rhaenyra's head snapped toward the direction of her son who turned to his younger brother. Jacaerys took a deep breath, "dragons can fly faster than ravens and they're more convincing," he said as Lucerys gave him a small nod.</p><p>"Send us," Jacaerys offered as Lord Corlys turned to Rhaenyra, "the prince is right, your Grace."</p><p>"Very well," Rhaenyra conceded. The prince looked at his mother with a serious expression as the Queen smiled slightly.</p><p>"Prince Jacaerys will fly north," she instructed, "first to the Eyrie to see my mother's cousin, the Lady Jeyne Arryn," she continued, "then to Winterfell to treat with Lord Cregan Stark for the support of the North."</p><p>Jacaerys nodded as Rhaenyra turned to her younger son, Lucerys, who stood in attention.</p><p>"Prince Lucerys will fly south to Storm's End and treat with Lord Borros Baratheon," Rhaenyra stated, "we must remind these lords of the oaths they swore and the cost of breaking them."</p>

<p>Rhaenyra watched the open sea with Ser Erryk by her side. Her sons would be flying to treat with the lords and ladies that she hopes would become their allies - she knew that they would be able to accomplish such feats but her heart was filled with worry for them still.</p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys approached their mother. Both princes' were dressed in riding gear with a sword strapped to their waists. They bore the sigil of House Targaryen on their chest as well as the colors of the banners that they fly. </p><p>Rhaenyra turned to her sons with scrolls in her hands, "it's been said that as Targaryens, we are closer to gods than to men," she chuckled slightly, "the Iron Throne puts us a touch closer, perhaps."</p><p>The two princes' smiled as their mother turned to the knight beside her, "if we are to serve the Seven Kingdoms, we must answer to their gods," she said as Ser Erryk held out the Book of the Seven for the princes' to see, "if you take this errand, you go as messengers and not as warriors." </p><p>Ser Erryk approached the two princes, "you must take no part in any fighting," Rhaenyra said, "swear it to me now under the eyes of the Seven," she commanded as the two princes turned to each other.</p><p>"I swear it," Lucerys was the first to place his hand on the book. Jacaerys hesitated before sighing and placing his hand on the book as well, "I swear it." </p><p>"Thank you," Rhaenyra nodded to the knight who took a step back. The Queen would then return her attention to her sons; she took a look at the scrolls in her hands before addressing them, "Cregan Stark is close to your age than to mine," she turned to Jacaerys and held out his scroll, "I would hope, that as men, you may be able to find some common interest." </p><p>The prince accepted the scroll, "yes, your Grace." </p><p>Lucerys took a step forward; Rhaenyra looked at him with a reassuring smile, "Storm's End is a short flight from here," she stated, "you have Baratheon blood from your grandmother, Rhaenys, and Lord Borros is an eternally proud man who would be honored to host a prince of the realm and his dragon," she said as she held her son's hand tightly in hers before placing the scroll upon it. </p><p>"I trust that both of you will receive a warm welcome," Rhaenyra nodded at Jacaerys and Lucerys. </p><p>“Your Grace,” Lucerys spoke up, “what if we encounter Ana?” </p><p>Rhaenyra’s eyes softened slightly, “then you shall extend to her an offer of a sanctuary with us.” </p><p>“And Aemond?” Jacaerys raised a brow. </p><p>“You are to offer the same to him,” Rhaenyra stated, “he is very much in love with your sister and I doubt that he would want to be separated from her.” </p><p>Jacaerys and Lucerys nodded at each other. The Black Queen looked at her sons proudly before smiling at them, "go to it then." <br/><br/></p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>The journey to Storm’s End proved to be easy enough for Aemond, Vhagar, and Vermithor - though, Levana was already starting to feel the effects of her pregnancy. She wasn’t as alert as she’d like and she wasn’t as fast as she liked - maybe it was the sign of an impending storm that made her lethargic but Aemond tried his best to fly by her side, much to the distaste of Vermithor who repeatedly tried to attack Vhagar. </p><p>Levana and Aemond arrived just before the first drops of rain. Aemond unmounted from Vhagar first so he could help Levana unmount from her own dragon. The princess insisted that she could still do and the prince allowed her to unmount slowly without his assistance. A small entourage of soldiers approached them as the princess hopped off her dragon.</p><p>“I am Prince Aemond Targaryen,” Aemond began, “my wife, Princess Levana, and I are here to deliver a message to Lord Borros from the king.” </p><p>The knights nodded and proceeded to march away from the both of them. Levana and Aemond followed; the prince held his wife’s hand tightly in his.</p><p>Despite the proud aura that the prince had about him, he - for the first time in a long time - was nervous to face the lord. Maybe it was because he was a relative to his wife or maybe because he was afraid of breaking the promise that he had made to her - regardless, there was a nervous feeling in his chest that he couldn’t quite get rid of.</p><p>“Princess Levana Velaryon and Prince Aemond of House Targaryen,” one of the squires announced as Levana and Aemond made their way into the Great Hall of Storm's End where Lord Borros sat on a throne in the center. </p><p>“Grandniece,” Lord Borros gestured at Levana, “I do appreciate that you have graced me with your presence.” </p><p>Levana bowed, “it’s been a while, granduncle.” </p><p>“The last time that we saw each other was at your wedding,” Lord Borros stated, “that was some three or four years ago?” </p><p>“three, granduncle,” Levana stated, “our children are just about the same age.” </p><p>“Splendid,” Lord Borros chuckled, “I understand that you are with child and yet you traveled to treat with me, I am honored.” </p><p>Levana bowed her head as Aemond took out the scroll from his pocket, “my husband has come to deliver a message from King Aegon.” </p><p>“Maester,” Lord Borros called as one of his maesters quickly approached Aemond who handed him the scroll. The maester scrambled to open it, quickly reading its contents before walking up to Lord Borros and whispering the contents to him. </p><p>“What do you have to give me in return?” Lord Borros asked, “grandniece, you surely do not expect me to give my support to the king without an exchange.” </p><p>Levana looked at her husband who cleared his throat, “what might you have in mind, Lord Borros?” </p><p>“I was to propose a marriage pact,” the Baratheon ruler turned to his daughter, “though, I am quite certain that it will put me at a disadvantage with the king and my own grandniece.” </p><p>Levana smiled at the comment as Aemond squeezed her hand tightly. The princess looked up at the prince who had a small smile on his face as if he was saying that getting the support of House Baratheon would come easily. </p><p>“Take one of my daughters as a mistress, Prince Aemond,” Lord Borros spoke suddenly. The request look the couple by surprise as the Baratheon chuckled loudly, “as my daughters would not be able to marry the prince, a mistress would be second best, don’t you think?” </p><p>“Do you jest, granduncle?” Levana asked in disbelief, “my husband is an honorable man.” </p><p>“You’re pregnant,” Lord Borros pointed out, “he would need someone by his side to satisfy his urges,” he continued, adding stress to his last word.</p><p>Levana turned to her husband who gritted his teeth in response. </p><p>“What say you, Prince Aemond?” </p><p>Aemond was silent. If he were to give an answer, that would put him in a pinch either way. Instead, he turned to his wife. Levana's other hand was balled into a fit and she was squeezing his hand tightly, so much so that the prince could’ve sworn that his hand had grown numb. </p><p>“If you come to me empty-handed, I cannot give you my support,” Lord Borros responded, “I’m sure you would understand, grandniece.” </p><p>Levana’s ears perked up, “Lord Borros, I will say it again, my husband is an honorable man and for you to even offer the thought of granting him a mistress puts your daughters, your own blood, in a humiliating position.” </p><p>“Marriage is what they are good for,” Lord Borros responded, “a prince of the realm steps into my home, requesting my loyalty, and I would be an imbecile if I did not take this to my advantage.”</p><p>The princess chuckled before letting go of her husband’s hand. She slowly walked to her granduncle, a sheepish smile on her face. She was only a few steps away from the seat when she stopped. She looked at her second cousins with a small smile before turning her attention back to Lord Borros who looked at her with a puzzled expression, “what is this, Princess Levana?” </p><p>“Granduncle, I ride Vermithor,” Levana stated, “the mount of King Jahaerys, and it would be pitiful if his flames were used on somebody like you.” </p><p>“Pardon, Princess Levana?” Lord Borros chuckled, “you are in my House’s seat and home!” </p><p>“It won’t be your seat for much longer if I decide to have my dragon burn Storm’s End to ashes,” Levana stated, “now would it, granduncle?” </p><p>“Why are you threatening me?!” </p><p>Screw the support that they needed from the Baratheons. She was not about to let anyone talk about her marriage that way — not when it was already in disarray. </p><p>“Have you no regard for your own daughters?” Levana asked, “have you no respect for my marriage?” </p><p>“You are asking for my support!” </p><p>“And I can force you into it if I wanted to,” Levana responded as a loud roar echoed through the halls of Storm’s End, “my dragon is one of the largest dragons alive, Lord Borros, and he can easily take all of you down should you decide to disrespect my marriage and your daughters again.” </p><p>Levana's blood boiled. She always thought of Lord Borros as honorable but the encounter proved everything but that.</p><p>Lord Borros was taken aback. He had always thought of his grandniece as someone who was demure and softspoken - this was the first time that he had seen her in such a fit of rage that it sent a shiver down his spine. Almost immediately, he got off his chair, raised his hands, and bent the knee. The members of his court and his children followed his actions, bending the knee as Levana looked around her.</p><p>At the realization of what she had just done, Levana felt disgusted - never in her life did she imagine that she would be using her own dragon as an instrument of fear. A part of her believed that Lord Borros absolutely deserved the venom in her words but there was also a part that believed that she may have gone too far. </p><p>Aemond approached his wife, wrapping an arm around her waist before pressing a kiss against her temple, “that was well done,” he whispered as he escorted her back to the center of the room. </p><p>Lord Borros stood up slowly, his hands still raised. He looked at his grandniece with fear before chuckling nervously, “let us prepare a feast for my grandniece and her husband,” he stated, “a token of a deal well struck.” </p><p>The knights and attendees quickly scrambled out of the room. Lord Borros’ daughters walked in front of Levana, bowing their hands in gratitude before leaving the Great Hall as well. </p><p>“Follow me,” Lord Borros gestured toward one of the doors, walking toward it. Levana and Aemond followed after him. </p><p>“Was that jealousy speaking?” Aemond whispered as Levana turned to face him, “no, it was my annoyance for his disrespect.” </p><p>“Shame,” the prince chuckled, “there is a certain attractiveness about you when you look jealous.” </p><p>“Do not get used to it, Aemond,” Levana hissed. The prince let out another chuckle as they continued to follow behind Lord Borros. </p><p>The princess walked beside her husband in silence as the latter conversed with Lord Borros about matters of the realm. She was disgusted by what she had just done and debated whether this was worth whatever she was fighting for. Of course, her children were her first priority and above all else, she was doing this for them - playing along with the desires of the Hand and the Dowager Queen so she could keep her children safe.</p><p>But just how long could she keep this up?</p>

<p>Levana felt uneasy throughout the entire feast. She felt nauseous and couldn't bear to eat at all. This didn't go unnoticed by her husband who sat by her side, holding her hand. He first noticed that his wife hardly touched the food that he had given her. He became more worried when the princess' breathing became labored.</p><p>Aemond alerted Lord Borros at once. The Baratheon was quick to rally his maesters to help take Levana to one of the rooms in the castle.</p><p>Lord Borros had the maesters attend to the princess before retreating back to the Great Hall with his daughters. Meanwhile, Aemond watched his wife from the door. He blamed his mother for forcing her to go through this but he also knew that the reason why his wife might've wanted to come was to prevent him from fighting with her brothers - should he encounter them.</p><p>One of the knights alerted Prince Aemond that another dragon has been spotted flying toward the castle. He smiled slightly, excusing himself before heading to the Great Hall. He stopped by one of the doors to see that one of his nephews have indeed come to Storm's End.</p><p>"Prince Lucerys Velaryon, son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen."</p><p>For now, at least, Aemond and Lord Borros would be able to face the young prince without the supervision of the princess.</p><p>"Lord Borros," Lucerys greeted, "I brought you a message from my mother, the Queen."</p><p>Lord Borros huffed, "yet earlier today, I received an envoy from the King," he responded. Aemond took this as his signal to emerge from where he was standing. His presence shocked the young prince yet Lucerys stood strong.</p><p>"Is it King or Queen?" Lord Borros asked, "the House of the Dragon seems to not know who rules it," he chuckled before leaning forward.</p><p>"What's your mother's message?"</p><p>Lucerys held out a scroll and a knight took it. He delivered it to Lord Borros who immediately summoned a maester. Just as he did with the message from King Aegon, the maester read the contents of the scroll and whispered it to the Lord of Storm's End.</p><p>"Remind me of my father's oath?" Lord Borros asked quite angrily, "King Aegon was at least able to prove to me the might that he possessed."</p><p>Lucerys took a small step back.</p><p>"My sword and banners for the safety of my House," Lord Borros boasted, "if I do as your mother bids, would you wed one of my daughters, boy?"</p><p>"My lord, I'm not free to marry," Lucerys said, "I'm already betrothed."</p><p>"So you come to me with empty hands," Lord Borros hissed, "go home, pup, and tell your mother that the Lord of Storm's End is not her dog that she can whistle up at need to bait her foes."</p><p>Lucerys nodded, "I shall take your answer to the Queen, my lord," Lucerys stated before turning his back. The young prince began his walk out of the Great Hall with the message from Lord Borros.</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Prince Lucerys stopped in his tracks to face Aemond who looked at him with a wicked smile, "my Lord Strong."</p><p>The younger of the two princes stepped back as Aemond chuckled, "did you really think that you could just fly about the realm trying to steal my brother's throne at no cost?"</p><p>"I will not fight you."</p><p>Aemond took a step closer to him.</p><p>"I came as a messenger," Lucerys declared, "not a warrior."</p><p>"A fight would be little challenge," Aemond stated as he proceeded to take off his eyepatch to reveal a sapphire where his eye would be. Lucerys gulped as he clutched the hilt of his sword tightly.</p><p>"I want you to put out your eye," Aemond demanded, "as payment for mine."</p><p>"Where is Ana?" Lucerys asked, "I saw Vermithor outside!"</p><p>"One will serve," Aemond ignored the younger prince as he threw his dagger toward the younger prince, "I will not blind you."</p><p>"Where is my sister?" Lucerys asked again but his questions fell on deaf ears.</p><p>"I plan to make a gift of it to my mother."</p><p>"No," Lucerys answered firmly.</p><p>"Then you are craven as well as a traitor," Aemond said in response.</p><p>"Not here!" Lord Borros raised his voice.</p><p>"Give me your eye or I will take it, bastard!" Aemond shouted as he walked towards Lucerys, picking up his dagger as he did so. The younger prince drew his sword as Lord Borros stood up from his seat.</p><p>"Not in my hall!" Lord Borros shouted, "the boy came as an envoy and I'll not have bloodshed beneath my roof," he continued before turning to one of the guards, "take Prince Lucerys back to his dragon, now!"</p><p>Aemond, for a moment, forgot his vow to his wife and decided that he would go out and mount Vhagar. The prince would command his dragon to fly; hiding in the clouds to wait for its prey.</p><p>Meanwhile, the princess sat up abruptly. She heard the unmistakable bellows of Vhagar from a distance even in the heavy rain. Concerned, she decided to peek out the window from the room where she was to spot her younger brother, Lucerys, running to his own dragon.</p><p>Her heart dropped.</p><p>Levana immediately rushed out of the room and to the Great Hall where Lord Borros was seated.</p><p>"My brother was here and no one bothered to inform me?!" Levana asked, "where is Prince Aemond?"</p><p>"The prince left on his dragon," Lord Borros stated, "he said that he would return for you."</p><p>Levana grunted as she made her way out of the hall, Lord Borros watching her as she left - he's definitely done something wrong.</p><p>"Lucerys!" Levana shouted but the prince had already commanded its dragon to fly off, "Luke!" she shouted again in the hopes of having a loud enough voice for her brother to hear her but it was to no avail. She gritted her teeth before rushing to her own mount.</p><p>Vermithor was restless. Either it was because of the rain or it was because of his rider's own uneasiness - one wouldn't know. Levana ran a hand through her dragon's neck in an attempt to soothe it.</p><p><em>"Please, Vermithor,"</em> Levana breathed as tears started to pool in her eyes, <em>"we have to catch up to Lucerys,"</em> she pleaded as her dragon grumbled. The princess mounted her dragon, ignoring the heavy drops of rain and once she was seated on her saddle, Vermithor spread his wings and shot up into the sky.</p><p>The princess already knew what was bound to happen.</p><p>For the first time in her life, Levana felt as though time was finally her enemy - she was in a race against it to find either her husband or her brother.</p><p>She needed to stop her husband but more than anything, she needed to save her younger brother.</p><p>Levana needed to stop her husband.</p>

</p><p>Lucerys held onto the reigns of his dragon for dear life. The rain was hard and he knew that Aemond was out there - hiding. He wanted to avoid the other prince as much as possible so he tried to fly relatively low, he knew that Vhagar wouldn't pass that low which would mean that he would be safer.</p><p>Still, the distant roars of another dragon and the lack of visibility made him nervous. His heart thumped loudly against his chest as he looked up - instinct made him do so as he felt something was above them.</p><p>Nothing was there except for the clouds.</p><p>The prince thought that he was safe until Vhagar intercepted their path by flying in front of them. Lucerys commanded his dragon to turn to the other side to avoid a collision. The task proved to be hard on both of them as Arrax was also just as uneasy.</p><p>Prince Aemond's laugh resonated loudly through the rain.</p><p>Lucerys took a deep breath as he turned his head to find Prince Aemond and Vhagar just behind him - catching up with them.</p><p><em>"Quickly, turn!"</em> Lucerys commanded as Arrax tried his best to follow his rider's commands. They found themselves flying closer to the sea and into a few rock formations - an attempt to shake off the other prince from their trail.</p><p>Aemond laughed, flying above the trenches, looking for them.</p><p><em><b>"You owe a debt, boy,"</b></em> Aemond called out.</p><p>
<b>
<em>"No, Arrax!"</em>
</b>
</p><p>Aemond turned his head to see the flames from Arrax's mouth collide with his dragon. This was enough to send Vhagar into a frenzy.</p><p>
<em>"No, Arrax, serve me!"</em>
</p><p>The older prince heard the pleas of his nephew as his own dragon began to shake angrily, "no, no, no, no, Vhagar!"</p><p>Aemond tried pulling on the reigns tightly, "serve me, Vhagar!" He commanded but his dragon wouldn't budge.</p><p>
<em>"Serve me, Vhagar!"</em>
</p><p>Just as Vhagar opened its mouth to catch Arrax, a wave of bronze was able to intercept the much larger dragon.</p><p>"Eva?" Aemond shouted, "what are you doing here?!"</p><p>Lucerys looked back, "Ana!"</p><p>The princess turned to her husband, <em>"what are you doing?!"</em></p><p>"It's just harmless fun!"</p><p><em>"You made a vow, Aemond!"</em> Levana shouted. But just as she was to give her husband another word, Vhagar hit Vermithor with her wings. This made the Bronze Fury fly farther from the prince.</p><p><em>"Vhagar, no!"</em> Levana pleaded, <em>"serve, Vhagar!"</em></p><p>The larger dragon seemed to stop for a while. Vhagar turned in Levana's direction, her eyes looking into the princess' as if she were in a trance. The interaction stunned Aemond, who loosened his hold on the reigns.</p><p>"How did you do that?"</p><p>"Ana!" Lucerys shouted again, "where are you?!"</p><p>Vhagar snapped out of its daze to pursue the younger prince once again.</p><p><b><em>"Vhagar, no!"</em></b> Levana shouted as Vermithor began to fly faster in another attempt to intercept Vhagar or at least catch up with Lucerys.</p><p>Vhagar disappeared into the clouds as Levana saw that her brother managed to escape from the storm. There was a wave of relief that washed through Levana's chest as she managed to catch up with her brother.</p><p>"Ana!" Lucerys said happily albeit still frantic and what just happened, "I knew you were in Storm's-"</p><p>Levana's eyes widened.</p><p>She shrieked.</p><p>The princess didn't even have a chance to blink when Vhagar had Arrax between her teeth.</p><p>"Lucerys!" Levana shouted loudly as she commanded her dragon to fly toward the sea. She was sobbing but she needed to retrieve her younger brother's body before it fell into the sea. The princess kept her arms open as Vermithor managed to avoid Arrax's falling body; the prince's body fell into Levana's arms as the princess tried her best to keep him awake.</p><p>"Luke?" Levana held his cheek, patting it, "Lucerys, please wake up," she pleaded as the prince slowly and weakly opened his eyes.</p><p>"Ana?" Lucerys coughed, "why are you crying?"</p><p>Levana quickly directed her dragon to land on one of the islands by Storm's End. Vermithor lowered his body so that his rider could unmount him. The princess knelt by the sand, holding her brother close to her as she sobbed.</p><p>"I'm going to take you to King's Landing," Levana choked on a sob, "the maesters are going to help you and you're going to be alright, I promise," she cried frantically as Lucerys shook his head.</p><p>"We should go home, Ana," Lucerys coughed blood, "mother wants to see you and our brothers too," he added.</p><p>Levana continued to cry as the younger prince held up his hand to touch his sister's cheek, "how are Baelon and Aemma?"</p><p>"They're doing well, Luke," Levana managed to say, "they ask for their uncles all the time."</p><p>"I miss them too," Lucerys responded weakly, "maybe after this, I can go see them, yes?"</p><p>The princess nodded as Aemond landed a few meters away from them. The blonde prince unmounted from his dragon and approached his wife. Vermithor, however, greeted the prince with a loud snarl, keeping him away.</p><p>"Ana, will you tell them that I love them?" Lucerys asked, "tell Baelon and Aemma that they have uncles who love them very much?"</p><p>"I will," Levana nodded, "I will, Luke."</p><p>The prince smiled as Levana held him tighter. She knew that even though she would be able to fly back to King's Landing, she wouldn't be able to save her younger brother. The wound that he had suffered from Vhagar was too great - so much so that the blood from it stained much of Levana's clothes.</p><p>"Will you sing to me, Ana?" Lucerys requested, "the lullaby that you used to sing for me and Jace?"</p><p>"Of course," Levana smiled slightly, "I will."</p><p>Lucerys nodded and wiped the tear from Levana's cheek with his thumb, "that's my favorite lullaby especially when you sing it."</p><p>Levana chuckled as she held her brother's hand tightly in hers, she began to sing:</p><p align="center">
<em>Drakari pykiros</em>
<br/>
<em>Tīkummo jemiros</em>
<br/>
<em>Yn lantyz bartossa</em>
<br/>
<em>Saelot </em>
<em>vāedis</em>
</p><p>Aemond watched and listened. He was crying as well - he did not mean to do what he did. He lost control of his dragon. Still, he knew that Lucerys' blood would be on his hands.</p><p align="center">
<em>Hen ñuhā elēnī:</em>
<br/>
<em>Perzyssy vestretis</em>
<br/>
<em>Se gēlȳn irūdaks</em>
<br/>
<em>Ānogrose</em>
</p><p>Levana held her brother tighter. She knew that he wouldn't last much longer as she felt his body grow limp. The realization made her sob more as she continued to sing:</p><p align="center">
<em>Perzyro udrȳssi</em>
<br/>
<em>Ezīmptos laehossi</em>
<br/>
<em>Hārossa letagon</em>
<br/>
<em>Aōt vāedan</em>
</p><p><b>"Ana?"</b> Lucerys called weakly as he looked at his sister, <b>"I love you."</b></p><p>Levana smiled slightly and leaned down to place a kiss on her brother's forehead. The prince's eyes closed and the princess could only hold his head to her chest, crying as she finished the song:</p><p align="center">
<em>Hae mērot gierūli:</em>
<br/>
<em>Se hāros bartossi</em>
<br/>
<em>Prūmȳsa sōvīli</em>
<br/>
<em>Gevī dāerī</em>
</p><p>The princess placed a hand on her brother's chest, feeling that his heartbeat was no more before hugging him tightly again. She cried towards the heavens as the storm finally cleared.</p><p>Of all the things that she didn't want to witness in her lifetime, losing a sibling was one of them - let alone one who she saw grow and one that she was close with. Levana stayed there, sobbing as she embraced Lucerys' body.</p><p>"Eva?" Aemond called as he approached her carefully. Vermithor had a scowl on its face as the prince knelt beside the princess.</p><p>"Fuck you," Levana turned to Aemond, "I know that you lost control of Vhagar but this wouldn't have happened if you didn't pursue my brother in the first place!"</p><p>Levana was right but Aemond was not about to admit that.</p><p>"He took my eye."</p><p>"So you take away his life?"</p><p>Aemond was taken aback as Levana slowly stood up; she tried her best to carry Lucerys back to Vermithor.</p><p>"Allow me to help you-"</p><p>"You've done enough, Aemond!"</p><p>The princess was successful in her attempts to mount her dragon with her younger brother's body in her arms.</p><p>"I empathize with you, Aemond for what has happened in the past, and I admit to the mistakes that my family has done toward you and your family," Levana cried, "even if you had lost control of Vhagar today, you had a choice and you chose to pursue my younger brother."</p><p>"I didn't want this, Eva!"</p><p>"How could you not want it?!" Levana raised her voice, "I heard you when I was chasing after the both of you, you said that he owed you a debt."</p><p>Aemond took a step back.</p><p>"Has the debt been paid, Aemond?" Levana asked, "my brother's life for your eye?!"</p><p>The prince was silent, "I didn't want this."</p><p>"I know that you didn't but you had a choice," Levana stated, "at the end of the day, it was your choice, and losing control of Vhagar is a blessing to you because now you don't have to suffer the blame of killing Prince Lucerys."</p><p>Aemond felt the coldness in his wife's words as Vermithor began to spread its wings.</p><p>"You've begun the war that my mother is trying so hard to avoid," Levana gritted her teeth, <em><b>"I hope you're proud, Aemond,"</b></em> she hissed before Vermithor shot up into the sky.</p><p>Aemond was stunned.</p><p>His wife was right.</p><p>
<b>He had begun the Dance of Dragons.</b>

</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Levana arrived back in the Dragonpit with Lucerys in her arms. The dragonkeepers tried to approach them but Vermithor kept them at bay; the only one that he allowed to approach was Ser Nandor. </p><p>The knight's eyes widened at the sight of the princess as she unmounted from her dragon. He offered to help the princess but she shook her head, Lucerys' body still in her arms as she scrambled towards one of the dragonkeepers — Anam — the one who came with her to King's Landing from Dragonstone. </p><p><em>"I need a pyre,"</em> Levana requested, <em>"a pyre for my brother." </em></p><p>Anam nodded as he began to gather the other keepers to prepare the pyre that she asked for. Meanwhile, Levana seated against her dragon, leaning her head on Vermithor as she began to clean Lucerys' face with a clean cloth that Ser Nandor gave to her. </p><p>"Where's the prince?" Ser Nandor asked as he placed a basin of water beside the princess. Levana dipped the cloth in the water before continuing to clean her brother. </p><p>"He should be here soon," Levana responded, "would you be able to find fresh clothes?" </p><p>Ser Nandor nodded as he bowed his head, leaving the princess to her devices. Aemond came sooner than expected and Vermithor was not happy to see him or Vhagar. </p><p>"Eva," Aemond took a deep breath, "please let me help you." </p><p>"Bring our children here," Levana stated, "I want them to be able to say their farewells to their uncle." </p><p>Aemond didn't contest it. He nodded and immediately left for the Red Keep. </p><p>"When you were born, I was so happy," Levana whispered, "I told myself that I was going to finally have someone that can bully Jacaerys with me," she chuckled to herself as she ran a cloth through Lucerys' hair. </p><p>"I love you and our brothers so much, Luke," Levana began to cry again, "if only mother didn't do what she has then we would still be together," she attempted to hold back her tears but it was to no avail. She continued to cry as Ser Nandor came with fresh clothes. </p><p>Anam came soon after to inform the princess that the pyre was ready for her. Levana slowly stood up, hugging her brother close to her as she slowly walked to the pyre. She lifted him up to place him on the pyre but her knees were starting to feel weak.</p><p>Ser Nandor noticed this and approached the princess but Levana shook her head, "I can do this," she whispered as she successfully placed Lucerys on the pyre. Ser Nandor handed the clothes that she requested and she slowly began to dress her brother in new clothes. </p><p>Aemond arrived moments later with a carriage and their children. Baelon and Aemma ran up to Levana but she refused to embrace them as she was drenched in blood and rain. </p><p>"We brought you clothes as well," Aemond offered his wife a dress but Levana refused. </p><p>"Say your farewells to your Uncle Lucerys," Levana choked on a sob, "this will be the last time that we will see him." </p><p>"Is he going to the same place as Grandsire?" Aemma asked as her mother nodded, "yes, he's going there as well." </p><p>Vermithor approached them with heavy steps. The dragon reciprocated the sadness felt by her rider as he approached them. He bellowed loudly, shaking as he spread his wings. </p><p>"Your uncle loves you very much," Levana smiled, "and he wants you to know that he'll always be watching over you." </p><p>Aemma and Baelon looked at their mother sadly before approaching the pyre. They looked at their uncle before bowing their heads, "farewell, uncle." </p><p>Levana wiped the tears from her eyes as her children waddled back to her. The twins held their mother's hand tightly as Levana turned to Aemond who kept his distance from them. </p><p>He knew that he had no right to be there. </p><p>"Dracarys." </p><p>Vermithor roared before releasing a large flame that quickly engulfed the pyre. Ser Nandor approached the princess with Lucerys' old clothes, the princess taking them and holding them close to her chest. </p><p>“Farewell, Lucerys.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Rhaenyra stood in front of her council, the lords were providing her with the latest information on the developments with the Greens. Others were assessing their military capabilities while others were in conversation about how they would be able to utilize strategy when occupying King's Landing. </p><p>Daemon walked into the Great Hall, his head hung down as he approached his wife. Rhaenyra looked at him with a puzzled expression as he neared them. Already, she knew that he must have news and from the look on her husband’s face, it was anything but good. </p><p>The Rogue Prince approached her, taking her hands into his own while escorting her away from the Painted Table. </p><p>"There's news," Daemond whispered as Rhaenyra raised a brow and excused herself from the table. </p><p>"Levana?" </p><p>Daemon shook his head as he held her hand tightly, squeezing it before whispering, "Lucerys," he took a deep breath, <em>“he didn’t make it.”</em> </p><p>Rhaenyra’s eyes widened as her husband let go of her hand. She was overcome by so many emotions that it was cathartic - the princess looked into the fire in rage and sadness as she placed her hands on her stomach. </p><p>Her son was gone. </p><p>The Black Queen gave Lucerys the nearest assignment so he could return home much quicker and safely but as fate would have it - she wouldn’t even have a body to bury or send to the pyre. </p><p>
<em>“Who did it?” </em>
</p><p><em>“Aemond and Vhagar,”</em> Daemon responded, <em>“Levana was there too.” </em></p><p>“Was she his accomplice?” Rhaenyra asked but Daemon kept silent, “goddamit, Daemon, fucking answer me!” </p><p>The members of her council turned towards her in shock as Daemon shook his head, “I could not say.” </p><p>“Ana wouldn’t wish ill of Lucerys,” Rhaenyra choked on a sob, “she loved her younger brother.” </p><p>“Just as she loves her husband,” Daemon looked at the floor, “I’ve told you time and time again that Levana is no longer on our side.” </p><p>“What would have me do, Daemon?” Rhaenyra asked, “I’ve already lost Visenya and Lucerys, do you want me to lose another child?” </p><p>
<b>“You lost Levana first.” </b>
</p><p>There was rage in Rhaenyra’s eyes as she looked at the Painted Table, the Greens have struck their first blow. With the wrath in her heart, the Black Queen was certain that she had to retaliate now. </p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Upon her return to the Red Keep, Levana was silent and unresponsive. She didn’t even fight back when she was once again taken into her Grandsire’s room while Aemond would tell the tale of what happened. </p><p>She didn’t care anymore. </p><p>What she did care about was how she and her children were going to escape from King’s Landing - with or without  her husband. </p><p>Ser Nandor stood by the door as Levana looked into the fire, “we will have to stop at Harrenhal,” she stated as the knight raised a brow. </p><p>“We need to surrender Lord Larys to his sister, Lady Nesrin,” Levana sighed, “as much as I want to enact justice for what he did to Lord Lyonel and Ser Harwin, it is not my place.” </p><p>“He’s admitted to that crime, Your Grace,” Ser Nandor reported, “he sent mute prisoners to burn down their castle.” </p><p>“Then Lady Nesrin would be very excited to know that,” Levana responded, “I’ve been hearing from other members of the Court that her one and only suspect was her older brother.” </p><p>Ser Nandor nodded, “we’ll take the passages to exit the Red Keep and I’ve contracted members of the City Watch to help us.” </p><p>“How sure are you that they wouldn’t betray us?” </p><p>“They were loyal to Ser Harwin,” Ser Nandor responded, “according to my sources, Ser Harwin instructed that you be protected under his wing as well.” </p><p>Levana chuckled, “must’ve felt bad for me as a child.” </p><p>“What about the prince?” </p><p>“He can catch up if he pleases,” Levana said in disdain, “he’s broken too many vows that my trust in him has diminished.” </p><p>Ser Nandor kept silent. </p><p>"We need to take Anam as well," Levana sighed, "Anam and Vad are Vermithor's keepers, we need to bring them." </p><p>"Maester Priamos also volunteered to escape with us," Sed Nandor added, "he was loyal to your Grandsire and served under Grand Maester Mellos." </p><p>Just as Levana was about to speak, the doors opened to reveal Alicent. Levana stood up and bowed, as did Ser Nandor as the Dowager Queen smiled at them. </p><p>"Ser Nandor, I wish to speak to my daughter alone." </p><p>"Right away, Your Grace," Ser Nandor bowed as he walked out of the room, closing the door behind him as Levana returned to her seat. Alicent walked to her and placed a hand on her shoulder. </p><p>"I'm sorry for your loss, my child." </p><p>Levana nodded in acknowledgement as Alicent took a seat opposite hers. </p><p>"I understand that you are angry at Aemond," Alicent sighed, "and you have every right to be but please do not push him away." </p><p>"Your Grace—" </p><p>"Mother." </p><p>"Mother," Levana sighed, "with all due respect, your son has given me much reason to push him away and if he continues with this route then I will be distant to him as he deserves it." </p><p>"What has your husband done to deserve your ire?" </p><p>"Many," Levana looked at the ring on her finger, "to the point where I sometimes question his love for me." </p><p>"Levana," Alicent took Levana's hand in hers, "Aemond loves you and gods forbid that his feelings have changed." </p><p>"Mother…" </p><p>"You have given my son a reason to live," Alicent said, squeezing Levana's hand, "you've given him reason to be happy — genuinely happy." </p><p>"It is without a doubt that he has given me the same," Levana took a deep breath, "but I also now have reason to question him." </p><p>In truth, Levana was not at the point where she didn't care much for what the Queen said about her husband. It was clear that she was trying to manipulate her and Levana wouldn't have that — not anymore.</p><p>"He will be punished for what he did to your brother," Alicent stated, "he will lose visitation rights to your children until he's learned the error of his ways and he will not be able to visit you as well." </p><p>"Then who will look after Baelon and Aemma if I cannot see them?" </p><p>Alicent smiled, "Baelon and Aemma will be staying with you from now on," she stated, "they've been apart from you for far too long." </p><p>Levana nodded with a small smile as the Dowager Queen did the same. At least now, she wouldn't have a difficult time collecting her children when it was time for them to escape.</p>

<p align="center">[<em>Italicized text denotes Valyrian speech]</em></p><p> </p><p>Levana's plans to escape from King's Landing were put in motion as soon as Ser Nandor received correspondence from House Greyjoy. Galatea assured them that her House would be in full support of Princess Levana and volunteered to help them make the escape. </p><p>It was decided that they would be heading to the Iron Islands instead of Dragonstone. As much as Levana wanted to go home, she wasn't so sure if she would still be welcome there when it was her husband that sent Lucerys to the pyre. </p><p>The princess kept her children in the dark with what they were about to do. They still spent time with the Dowager Queen and the last thing that Levana wanted was for her children to expose their plot. </p><p>Maester Priamos also sent word in advance to Lady Nesrin Strong that they would be delivering her older brother to them within a few days time. She wasn't so sure what she would do with support from House Strong but at the very least, she would have allies. </p><p>It's been five days since Lucerys' death and Princess Levana was restless. </p><p>Apart from planning their escape, Levana spent most of her sleepless nights in the company of her Grandsire's sculptures. She spent hours cleaning them and even changing the positions of certain figures. It didn't do much but it did provide her with a way to clear her mind. </p><p>During those days, Helaena would come visit them with her own children. Baelon and Aemma had grown close to their cousins: Jaehaerys, Jaehera, and Maelor — it was a welcome sight. On some nights, they would also visit the Dowager Queen in her residence at the Tower of the Hand. </p><p>More than anything, Levana was glad that she was allowed out of her confinement. It did well for the children as they would stop asking to see their father from time to time. </p><p>Aemond kept his distance from them. As he wasn't allowed to see them, the prince would stay content with being able to watch them from afar. Aemma and Baelon would wave at him every now and then but they are constantly reminded that they weren't allowed to approach their father for the time being. </p><p>It pained Levana to see her children in dismay when they couldn't even embrace their father. She knew that they must miss him. </p><p>She did too. </p><p>"We're leaving tomorrow night," Ser Nandor stated, "everything is set and Maester Priamos has left in advance with Vad and Lord Larys, they should be on their way to Harrenhal as we speak." </p><p>Levana nodded at the report, "at least we'd have Harrenhal and House Strong for now." </p><p>"I've also sent word to Dorne," Ser Nandor reported, "I have yet to receive a reply from Prince Sorin but he usually prefers words than actions." </p><p>"You're fond of each other," Levana smiled, "aren't you?" </p><p>"Like you wouldn't believe, Your Grace," Ser Nandor chuckled. </p><p>Ser Nandor kept no secrets from the princess. She knew that Prince Sorin and him were very close — their relationship reminded Levana of her father and Ser Qarl. </p><p>Sometimes, she wondered what her father would do given the situation. Though, she believed that, if Ser Laenor were alive, they would be in the safety of High Tide by now. </p><p>"Which handmaids are coming with us, Princess Levana?" </p><p>"Well, we need to bring at least two nurses for the children and at least two handmaidens would do," Levana responded, "you're good at seeing through people so I will leave that to you." </p><p>Ser Nandor bowed his head as the door opened to reveal Helaena with the children. </p><p>"Queen Helaena," Ser Nandor greeted as Baelon and Aemma ran into the room to take their mother by her hands.</p><p>"It's time to visit grandma!" Aemma said excitedly as Levana stood up from her seat. The princess nodded at Ser Nandor who did the same. </p><p>"Sister," Helaena smiled, "how are you?" </p><p>"It could be much worse," Levana responded, "but I feel that things will start getting better soon." </p><p>"I do hope so," Helaena responded as the children walked ahead of them. This allowed the two females to have a few moments to themselves. </p><p>"Aemond misses you," Helaena whispered, "sometimes, I see him standing in front of your door," she added. </p><p>"I miss him just as much," Levana confessed, "but our time apart has allowed me to reflect about our marriage and what has happened thus far." </p><p>"He stopped flying, you know," Helaena sighed, "the King orders him to go on patrols but he never takes Vhagar anymore." </p><p>"He goes on horseback?" </p><p>"Sometimes it's horseback but sometimes he also commands the fleet," Helaena smiled, "I don't think he's been to the Dragonpit since the incident." </p><p>Levana smiled slightly as they continued to follow after the children. </p><p>The night was deep as they walked through the Tower of the Hand. But, for some reason, the atmosphere was tense and heavy — it was never like this before. Levana wondered if Helaena or Ser Nandor could feel it too. </p><p>Maybe she was just overthinking. </p><p>"Mother?" Aemma called as Levana looked down at her daughter who was waddling at her side with Baelon following shortly after. </p><p>"Yes, my beautiful?" Levana asked as Aemma thought for a while before finally speaking, "when is father coming to see us again?" </p><p>Levana smiled lovingly as they neared the Queen's chambers, "in a few days, my darling." </p><p>Levana would never deny Aemond of their children. He was an amazing father to them and she wouldn't imagine taking away the children from their father. </p><p>Helaena opened the doors of Alicent's chambers and walked in with her children; Levana followed her lead with her own as the former began to call out the Dowager Queen's name. There was no response, instead, there was a loud bang on the door and Aemma's shriek filled the air as her younger brother was taken away from her. </p><p>"Scream again and you all die," The assailant spoke as he held a knife up to Baelon's neck - Levana could only watch as Aemma ran to her side, clutching her dress. It was only then that she noticed another assailant holding Maelor from the corner of her eye.</p><p>"Who are you?" Helaena asked as the of them snickered,<b> "we're debt collectors."</b> </p><p>"An eye for an eye, a son for a son." </p><p>"A daughter for a daughter." </p><p>Levana's eyes shot wide open as she realized who might have sent them. She walked in front of Aemma as Helaena pleaded for the life of her child. </p><p>"We only want two to square things off," the other spoke with a chuckle, "won't hurt the rest of you, not one little hair." </p><p>The same assailant turned to Levana with a smile, "you must be the one we're looking for, Your Grace." </p><p>At this point, Levana could hear Helaena's begging, "me?" </p><p>"Received the directive that it has to be your children." </p><p>Levana's eyes widened as she held Aemma close to her. She could hear Ser Nandor's banging against the door but it was barred.</p><p>
<b>"It has to be yours." </b>
</p><p>Helaena looked at Levana with reddened eyes as she continued to plead with the assailants, Aemma clutched her mother's skirt as she looked at her older brother. </p><p>"Time's ticking, your Grace," The taller of the two chuckled, "better choose one quick or my partner might just make a wife out of your daughters." </p><p>Levana took a deep breath, "who sent you?" </p><p>"Doesn't matter," The one holding Maelor responded, "just make your choice." </p><p>In her mind, Levana already knew who sent them. She knew very well that only one person was capable of doing such a thing.</p><p>That also meant that the choice would have to be hers to make and she would not let Helaena lose one of her children because of what her husband has done. </p><p>"We seem to have one right," the man who had Baelon spoke, "the other one must be the girl behind the princess." </p><p>Levana looked at her son's eyes. He was frozen in fear as a dagger was held to his neck. </p><p>"Don't make this hard for you, Your Grace." </p><p>The other man finally let Maelor go as he advanced towards Levana. Aemma was sobbing as she held her mother tightly. </p><p>"Either we take this one or the one in your belly." </p><p>Levana's eyes shot wide. Just as the assailant was about to reach for Aemma, the princess managed to give him a punch in the face. This allowed Levana to charge towards the other man but she wasn't able to reach him in time. </p><p>The man had slit her son's neck. </p><p>Levana watched in horror as Baelon's body fell to the ground and blood began to drench the floor. She turned back to look at Aemma and was about to make a beeline for her but the man who had just murdered her son grabbed her and forced her to her knees. </p><p>"Aemma, don't let them catch you!" </p><p>The younger princess was frozen in fear as Levana tried her best to budge. Helaena, on the other hand, began to untie her mother while her children cried. </p><p>"Aemma!" </p><p>The other man had stabbed her daughter. Levana could do nothing but scream loudly. </p><p>"A daughter for a daughter," The larger of the two stated,<b> "lost both a daughter and a son, gotta even out the playing field." </b></p><p>Levana froze in terror as the assailants disappeared into the darkness. The Dowager Queen rushed to Levana, shaking her and trying to calm her down. For a moment, all Levana could do was stare at the blood that pooled from the bodies of her children - when the realization finally hit her, she began sobbing uncontrollably. </p><p>Alicent wrapped her arms around Levana, trying her best to comfort her when she herself couldn't stop from screaming. Helaena, on the other hand, tried her best to console her children while watching her mother and Levana.</p><p>Levana weeped into Alicent's arms as the Queen tried her best to comfort the princess.</p><p>Ser Nandor was finally able to break the door open and guards started to search the room. Otto escorted Helaena and her children out of the room while the Dowager Queen continued to comfort Levana.</p><p>Levana was beyond consolation. She was shouting, screaming, and cursing - even after more guards had rushed into the room and Otto had ordered them to retrieve Prince Baelon and Princess Aemma's body.</p><p>For the first time in her life, Levana knew true anger and hatred. As she sobbed, she swore that she would avenge her children by any means. </p><p>Even if it meant making an enemy out of her own mother.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The events that followed after that encounter were a blur for Levana who sat on her desk, writing a long letter to her mother detailing what had transpired and that their grandchildren were now dead.</p><p>She must have started a dozen letters by now but she scrapped each one. </p><p>None of the letters could convey her rage and sorrow upon losing her children. She wanted to understand why it had to come to this and why couldn't they just take her in place of Lucerys. </p><p>"My love?" </p><p>Levana didn't turn to acknowledge the male standing behind her, instead, she chose to continue writing. Aemond knew for a fact that his wife was beyond mad and she had every right to be so. </p><p><em>"Do you now see the consequences of your actions?"</em> Levana stated as she put her quill down,<em> "are you glad that you made that choice, Aemond?" </em></p><p>Aemond took a deep breath, "I will avenge our children, Levana." </p><p>"And how do you propose to do that, Aemond?" Levana asked, "our children are gone!" </p><p>Aemond stood there as Levana sobbed.</p><p>"I had to watch my children die, Aemond!" Levana continued as Aemond stayed silent, "do you really love your children when you didn't even think of them when you made your choices?" </p><p>"Eva..."</p><p>"Your actions are the reasons why your children have to suffer!</p><p>Aemond was starting to get angered by his wife's accusations - not because they were wrong but because he knew that, ultimately, they were what had caused this series of unfortunate events to happen. </p><p>
<em>"Do you even love us the way you say you do, Aemond?" </em>
</p><p>That set him off and for the first time in the years that they have been married, Aemond raised a hand to his wife. </p><p>He did not hit her but the gesture was enough to make Levana stand up from her chair.</p><p><b>"Go ahead,"</b> Levana challenged, <b>"hit me, Aemond,"</b> she smiled mockingly, <b>"prove to me that you love me this way." </b></p><p>"What do you want from me, Levana?" Aemond asked as he removed his eyepatch, "I lost my children too." </p><p>"You do realize that you are the reason why we lost both of them, yes?" Levana asked.</p><p>"I know, Levana!" Aemond shouted in response, "you do not have to keep on tormenting me with that fact!" </p><p>Levana was taken aback. </p><p>"I know that I'm the reason why they came for the children in the dead of night," Aemond stated, "I know that I caused the death of our children," he added as he walked towards his wife, placing his hands on either side of her face.</p><p>
<em>"I know of the monster that I am, Levana." </em>
</p><p>The female stood still as she saw the tears that were being shed by her husband, "I already lost my children," Aemond leaned his forehead against hers, "please." </p><p>Levana didn't speak.</p><p><em>"I don't want to lose you, Levana,"</em> Aemond whispered, <em>"you're all that I have left."</em> </p><p><em>"I wish I could say the same,"</em> Levana responded, <b>"I'm done, Aemond." </b></p><p>"What do you mean, Eva?" </p><p>"I'm not about to lose myself because of you," Levana sighed, "you've broken too many vows and I am done with false promises." </p><p>"Levana—" </p><p>"You can stay in King's Landing for as long as you want but I am leaving," Levana stated firmly, "if you try to stop me or if you so much as tell the Hand or your mother that I plan to leave then I will gouge out your other eye." </p><p>Aemond was taken aback. He felt the rage in his wife's words and raised his hands in defeat. </p><p>"They will not hear anything from me." </p><p>"Good," Levana hissed, "otherwise, Vhagar risks losing another rider." </p><p>"Where will you go?" </p><p>"None of your business," Levana spat, "you're so loyal to your brother and your faction that I can no longer trust you." </p><p>Aemond felt his heartbreak. That was it. </p><p>He lost his children.</p><p>He lost his wife.</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>When someone loses a husband or a wife, they become a widow or a widower.</p><p>When a child loses their parents, they become an orphan.</p><p>But what about a mother who loses a child? What do you call them?</p><p>There is no word to describe them.</p><p>
<b>There is nothing that can describe the pain and sorrow of a mother who has lost a child.</b>
</p><p>Levana stood in front of her of two pyres, while Vermithor stood behind her. The only ones in attendance were the royal family and their dragons - a few knights were present as well as the Lords of the Small Council.</p><p>Aemond stood in front of his wife, with Vhagar behind him.</p><p><em>"Before they were killed,"</em> Levana began, <em>"Aemma asked me when you would come to see us again, but I never expected this type of reunion."</em></p><p>Aemond remained silent. He couldn't bear to look at this wife — he was ashamed.</p><p>Of all their family members, the one most affected by their death was the Dowager Queen Alicent. She loved her grandchildren and the fact that she was there when they were killed only added to the grief that she shared with Levana.</p><p><em>"They will pay for this,"</em> Levana muttered,<em> "I'm going to make them pay."</em></p><p>"Eva," Aemond looked at her, <em>"you can't go to Dragonstone alone."</em></p><p><em>"I have Vermithor," </em>Levana said, <em>"they stole my children from me so I'm going to steal all their chances of ever winning this war."</em></p><p>"Eva, Aemond," Alicent called, "it's time."</p><p>Aemond nodded at his mother before approaching his wife and escorting her to the side. Levana looked at the pyres with an expression that no one would be able to understand.</p><p>
<b>Losing a child was a different kind of pain and suffering.</b>
</p><p><b><em>"Dracarys,"</em></b><em> </em>Levana and Aemond said in unison as their dragons unleashed flames upon their children's pyres.</p><p>Just a few days ago, Levana had to send her younger brother to the pyre and now, she had done the same for her children.</p><p>The Dowager Queen, of course, did as any grandmother would and ordered the arrest of the assailants. She commanded the City Watch to look day and night for the men who took her grandchildren and it was only a matter of time before they got caught.</p><p><em>"Will you still leave?" </em>Aemond asked as Levana nodded, <em>"if I am to save myself, I will have to leave King's Landing for greener pastures."</em></p><p><em>"I'm not stopping you," </em>Aemond responded, <em>"but will you at least allow me to help you?"</em></p><p><em>"Help me with that?" </em>Levana raised a brow, <em>"you've done enough, Aemond."</em></p><p><em>"I can help you get to the Dragonpit, at least," </em>Aemond offered, <em>"consider it my farewell."</em></p><p>Levana smiled slightly, <em>"it's only a farewell if you don't have an intention of saying hello to me again."</em></p><p>Aemond chuckled, at the very least, he knew there was a slight chance that he would be welcome in his wife's life again - whenever that would be and if he survived the impending war.</p><p>"Ana," Alicent called, "we'll be returning to the palace."</p><p>Levana turned to her with a small smile and nodded before turning to Aemond, "are you not going to join them?"</p><p><em>"These are my last few hours with my wife and child," </em>Aemond smiled, <em>"I would want to spend it with her before she leaves me."</em></p><p>"I will be heading west," Levana revealed, "where exactly is what I cannot tell you."</p><p>"Why will you be heading to Dragonstone?"</p><p>"To give my mother a piece of my mind," Levana stated, "Daemon as well."</p><p>Aemond turned to her with a concerned expression, "alone?"</p><p>"I'll have Vermithor," Levana turned to her dragon, "he is all I need."</p><p>The prince knew that he wouldn't be able to convince his wife to take him along nor allow him to at least be by her side at Dragonstone but at the very least, he would do her good on the vow that he made.</p><p>He was not about to betray her - not when all he's done just that and it cost them their children.</p><p>"At least take this with you," Aemond stated as he approached his wife, presenting her with a sword.</p><p>"Where did you get that?" Levana asked as her eyes widened at the realization that it was the Conqueror's sword. Aemond chuckled slightly as he placed the sword in his wife's hands, admiring her as she looked at the sword.</p><p>"I stole it from Aegon," Aemond responded, "he's not going to realize that's gone anyway."</p><p>"Why would you do this?" Levana asked, "why would you give me his sword?"</p><p>"Because you deserve it," the prince responded, "if you're going to face your mother and rain hell on her, you might as well have the proper weapon for it."</p><p>Levana looked up at him and smiled, "thank you, Aemond."</p><p>"This is the very least that I could do, my love," Aemond placed a hand on her stomach, "after all that I've done."</p><p>The princess placed a hand on her husband's cheek and pulled him close to her until their foreheads met, "please, for my sake, try your best to stay alive," she whispered as Aemond chuckled a response and wrapped an arm around his wife's waist.</p><p>"I will do more than that," Aemond promised, "but first, you need to escape from King's Landing with Vermithor," he said before placing a kiss on top of Levana's head.</p><p>"I know you will but please keep safe," the prince requested, "we still don't know how strong your mother's forces are and since you are alone, you'll be outnumbered."</p><p>Levana nodded as Vermithor bellowed. The flames on the pyres finally went out as the couples turned to them. The princess approached the pyres, watching the ashes as they began to scatter with the wind. At the very least, her children suffered a quick death - far better than what she had in mind for the assailants that took them from her.</p><p>"Eva," Aemond called as the princess turned to him with a small smile, "yes, husband?"</p><p>"I just realized it," Aemond chuckled, <b>"It's your Name Day today."</b></p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>The Harvest Moon illuminated the sky with its undeniable beauty.</p><p>Levana looked at the sky from her Grandsire's chambers before sighing and looking around - this would be the last time that she would be here and she wasn't so sure that she would be able to come back.</p><p>Ser Nandor was waiting for her by the passageway - he traded his white cloak for armor that was much simpler; one that allowed him to move much easier. Levana, on the other hand, traded her dress for riding gear - one that was red and bore the Targaryen sigil in gold.</p><p>"Ready, your Grace?"</p><p>The princess took a deep breath before nodding to her sworn protector. She secured the Valyrian Dagger by her waist and sheathed the Conqueror's sword just beside it before making her way towards the passage. She picked up a black cloak along the way and wrapped it around her shoulders before finally walking out of the room.</p><p>Ser Nandor closed the door to the passage and began to walk ahead but Levana lingered for a while, a tear escaping her eyes as she turned her back.</p><p>She's leaving the life that she knew, hopefully, for better things.</p><p>"Anam is waiting for us at the Dragonpit with the prince," Ser Nandor stated, "I had one of our allies check and it doesn't seem that Prince Aemond betrayed us."</p><p>Levana chuckled as she followed behind Ser Nandor, "if he betrayed me this time, I'd have his other eye for it."</p><p>"The keepers also prepared the whelps that belonged to Princess Aemma and Prince Baelon," Ser Nandor reported, "but if you don't mind me asking, Your Grace, where do you plan to use them?"</p><p>"Have you ever heard of the wild dragons that reside in Dragonstone?" Levana asked, "one of them is called Cannibal and it's for very obvious reasons."</p><p>"But you can use the whelps, Your Grace," Ser Nandor reasoned, "more dragons for our cause."</p><p>"No," Levana replied plainly, "those are my children's dragons and I do not want them to bond with anyone else and besides, my mother gave them those eggs."</p><p>Ser Nandor nodded; he was not about to argue with that logic - the princess had every right to burn bridges with her mother after what happened two nights ago. The image of the weeping princess and the bodies of the children on the floor haunted him to no end.</p><p>Once they were able to navigate through the passages, Levana looked at the Red Keep once more time before taking a deep breath and placing a hood over her head to cover her hair. She clutched her cloak tightly to hide the sigil on her chest. King's Landing was much different at night - Levana didn't know how to describe it but the atmosphere was heavy just as it was damp.</p><p>One of the members of the City Watch met them by one of the alleyways - Ser Nandor nodded to him and he began to walk in front of them. Soon enough, they reached the Dragonpit where Aemond stood beside Anam. He held the whelps by chains around their necks as Levana approached them with a heavy heart. Aemond looked at the princess with a sad expression as he met her halfway.</p><p>"Don't look at me that way," Levana whispered as Aemond chuckled, "I am about to lose my wife, I am entitled to look as sad as I want."</p><p>The prince handed the chains to the princess who looked at the small dragons with a longing expression - her children would've been excellent riders just like her and their father but alas, they were taken away from them too early.</p><p>Vermithor soon marched out of the pits with heavy steps, the keepers replaced his saddle with one that was red and gold - adequately matching the princess' attire.</p><p>Levana took a deep breath as she began to approach her dragon but she was stopped by Aemond who held her hand and pulled her towards him, capturing her lips in a kiss. The princess melted into his touch; she missed him - that much was undeniable.</p><p>When Aemond broke the kiss, he looked into his wife's eyes and placed a kiss on her forehead, "be safe."</p><p>Levana nodded before mounting her dragon and turning to Ser Nandor and Anam, <b>"I will see you in Harrenhal."</b></p><p>With that, Vermithor took to the skies and headed for Dragonstone.</p><p>

<p>Infiltrating Dragonstone was far from an easy task.</p><p>Levana figured that they would have patrols surrounding the island, so the princess decided to fly over Dragonstone and back so she could land on one of the outer islands and trek towards the Dragonmont. However, given her pregnancy, she had to take it slow; apart from that, she didn't know how many troops her mother scattered across the island.</p><p>Her plan was to try to claim some of the wild dragons - if not all - for her own cause, whatever that may be. It would hinder her mother from adding dragons to her forces and, in turn, give her a more challenging time gaining the upper hand against the Greens.</p><p>The Greens were the least of her worries in terms of dragons. Only her husband was a full-fledged dragonrider among the three of them - heck, she doesn't even think Aegon would last minutes in the field on dragonback if Aemond weren't there.</p><p>She didn't think to bring a torch - that would just give away her position - she instead relied on the light from the Harvest Moon as she made her way to one of the mounts, spotting one of the dragons that she came for from a distance.</p><p>Many feared the wild dragon, Cannibal, because of its size and because it ate its own kind. This is why Levana brought along the whelps that once belonged to her children.</p><p>The princess approached the large dragon with caution. Cannibal was easily larger than Vermithor but the difference wasn't a lot. The dragon looked at the princess with its piercing green eyes as Levana placed the chains of the whelps on the ground not too far from where Cannibal was resting.</p><p><em>"Accept my offering, Cannibal," </em>Levana gestured for the whelps, <em>"serve me."</em></p><p>The large dragon began to stand from its position and slowly made its way to Levana; its heavy steps shook the ground as it approached the whelps and in one swoop, they were gone - devoured by the dragon in front of her.</p><p>Levana held out her hand, the scene reminded her of when she claimed Vermithor as a child; she figured that, at least, even if she died today, she can say that she died trying to claim wild dragons for her own - no one has done that and the fact that she tried was enough.</p><p>Cannibal bumped its snout on Levana's hand as its expression softened. Immediately, Levana smiled in shock; was it truly that easy?</p><p>The dragon grumbled as it breathe fire toward the heavens before turning to Levana again, its eyes looking into her own. Slowly, Levana brought up her other hand to touch the dragon's snout and its reaction was to push its head toward her.</p><p>The princess chuckled as she turned her back and began to walk away.</p><p>That was one. She needed two more.</p><p>As she navigated through the Dragonmont, she saw Vermithor flying above her and landing in front of one of the caverns. She didn't worry - no one would dare to ride a bonded dragon, after all.</p><p>Levana wandered through the terrain with Cannibal in tow, stopping only when she spotted a dragon from a distance. At first, she couldn't believe her eyes but the dragon heavily resembled one that she often saw in her dreams and visions - much like Cannibal. The princess took this as a sign and began to approach, much to the black dragon's dismay.</p><p>The first that the princess noticed about the dragon was its pale grey-white color and as she continued her approach, she noticed that the dragon was looking at her. This startled her for a bit as she didn't know how this dragon would even react once she was just a few feet away from it but she continued her pursuit.</p><p>At the very least, Cannibal was behind her.</p><p>Levana looked at the dragon and for a while, it seemed like it was about to fly away - that was a wasted chance. The princess resulted to doing something that she never thought would work but still, she gave it a try.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>She stopped in front of the dragon, <em>"Grey Ghost, serve me, I implore you."</em></p><p>The dragon looked at her plainly before spreading its wings. It looked at Levana before taking a few steps back and lowering its neck; it looked as if the dragon was bowing to her as the princess approached it. She placed a cautious hand on the dragon's head before it leaned against her touch.</p><p>Levana smiled, she had three now. All that was left was Silverwing.</p><p><em>"Find Vermithor," </em>Levana commanded as she mounted Grey Ghost; the two dragons took to the sky as they flew towards one of the larger mountains of the Dragonmont - the same one that she claimed Vermithor in as a child.</p><p>Grey Ghost and Cannibal landed outside the cavern; Levana unmounted from her dragon, stroking its neck before turning to Cannibal.</p><p><em>"If anyone tries to come, burn them," </em>Levana ordered as she made her way inside the cavern, grabbing a torch as she walked inside.</p><p>"Vermithor?" The princess called as she began to walk through the passages. The torch didn't do much to illuminate her way but at the very least, she could see where she was going.</p><p>There was a low rumble that resounded through the caverns - one that Levana recognized to be that of Vermithor's. She made her way toward the sound and arrived at a cavern; it was illuminated by the light of the Harvest Moon from a large hole above it.</p><p>While she didn't want to believe it, this looked like the very same cavern that she claimed Vermithor in many moons ago.</p><p>Levana found her dragon easily enough, nestled with another dragon.</p><p>"That must be Silverwing," Levana whispered to herself as she approached them, her dragon looked at her with a knowing expression. Silverwing, on the other hand, hid behind Vermithor, scared.</p><p><em>"I'm not going to hurt you," </em>Levana said as she continued her approach, <em>"come with us, Silverwing."</em></p><p>The female dragon slowly walked away from Vermithor to meet the princess, her eyes looking into her own as if it was looking for something.</p><p><em>"I'm Queen Alysanne's granddaughter," </em>Levana smiled, <em>"you will be safe with me, I swear it."</em></p><p>Silverwing's expression softened as she lowered her head, Levana placed a hand on her snout, stroking it as she looked at the moon above - it seemed to shine brighter now.</p><p><em>"We have to go," </em>Levana said as the two dragons took to the sky. The princess, on the other hand, made her way back to the entrance to retrieve Cannibal and Grey Ghost when she was met by the sight of her mother, standing in a distance.</p><p>Anger immediately swelled in Levana's chest as she walked past her two dragons to look at her mother - crowned with her Grandsire's own; the one that she asked Ser Erryk to give her.</p><p>"Levana, you're home"</p><p>

Rhaenyra was taken aback, a look of shock on her face as she watched Grey Ghost and Cannibal move to Levana's side in a motion to protect her.</p><p>"Where's Vermithor?" Rhaenyra asked, "surely you wouldn't abandon your own dragon."</p><p>"Like you abandoned your own daughter?"</p><p>The Black Queen took a step back, "how dare you?"'</p><p>"No, Queen Rhaenyra, how dare <b>you</b>?"

Rhaenyra raised her voice, "you were there, were you not?"</p><p>"Vhagar killed my brother," Levana corrected, "my husband didn't."</p><p>"Of course," the older female laughed, "you always run to your husband's side as if he was the one that defended you all your life."</p><p>It was Levana's turn to laugh now, "as a matter of fact, mother, he was the only one who stood by my side."</p><p>"I was by your side, Levana!"</p><p>"You abandoned me when I was just a child to marry Daemon!"

The prince stood beside his wife as he watched Levana, "I must say, that's impressive, stepdaughter."</p><p>"Daemon," Levana glared, "nice of you to join us, maybe you can tell my mother what you did with her grandchildren."</p><p>"There's nothing to tell," Daemon chuckled, "I sent debt collectors and they did their job."</p><p>"You killed my children," the princess began, "Aemma and Baelon don't even know how to read and write properly yet."</p><p>"Lucerys was heir to Driftmark--"</p><p>"Is that all you can say to your defense?!" Levana shouted, "is everything about the succession to you when you have lost your grandchildren to the only legitimate child that you had with your first husband?!"</p><p>"Are you calling your brothers what I think you are?"</p><p>Levana stood straight, "aren't they exactly that?'</p><p>"Levana Velaryon," Rhaenyra stepped forward, earning a scowl from the dragons that surrounded her daughter, <b>"how dare you?"</b></p><p>"Again, mother, <b>how dare you?</b>" Levana returned the question, "you filled their heads that no matter what, they are Targaryens when you know deep in your heart that no matter how hard you try, they will never be."</p><p>"Levana--"</p><p>"You poisoned my brothers' heads with your own lies," Levana shot, "you had them believing for years that they are not what people say they are but you know that they're bastards."</p><p>"Quite a show you're putting on, princess," Daemon chuckled, "what are you trying to achieve here?"</p><p>"I'm going to put an end to this fucking war that you're all trying to start," Levana stated, "King Viserys never wanted war and the fact that you're so willing to begin it now makes you unsuitable to be his heir."</p><p>"They killed your brother."</p><p>"I mourned for my brother," Levana took out Lucerys' cape from the bag attached to her hip, "I had to send my brother to the pyre because you sent him to the battlefield."</p><p>Rhaenyra looked at the cape in Levana's hands, it was the exact same one that Lucerys had worn the day that he died. The Black Queen thought for a while before looking at the dragons and then back at Levana, "I sent them as messengers."</p><p>"The moment that you sent my brothers under your cause made them your soldiers," Levana stated, "whether or not you sent them as messengers don't matter now."</p><p>"So, what do you plan to do, Levana?" Daemon asked, "I'm sure you won't be siding with the Greens but you won't be siding with us either."</p><p>"I'm choosing my own cause," Levana stated, "I'm going to stop this war that all of you are so keen on bringing into the realm when my Grandsire never willed for a war over his succession in the first place."</p><p>"You and what army, princess?" Daemon chuckled, "there's only probably you and a small brigade, you have nothing."</p><p><b>"Armies didn't win wars, stepfather,"</b> Levana responded, <b>"dragons did and last I checked, I now have four of the largest dragons alive and Seasmoke."</b></p><p>"Your father's dragon was stolen."</p><p>"And I know who stole him," Levana confessed, "Seasmoke is better in my company than in yours."</p><p>"You're going to die, Levana," Daemon laughed, "you have nothing."</p><p>"Daemon," Rhaenyra turned to her husband, "let me handle this."</p><p>Levana turned to her dragons and called for Vermithor who swooped down and landed in front of the princess. She mounted her dragon as the three others spread their wings; Vermithor snarled at Princess Rhaenyra and Daemon; both seemed unaffected for the most part.</p><p>"If I win this war," Levana began, "it's going to end with your end on a spike, Daemon Targaryen," she threatened, "I will avenge my children and the realm."</p><p>"Why would you avenge the realm?" Daemon laughed, "you are merely a princess and without your mother, you are nothing."</p><p>"No," Levana responded, "I am the heir to the Iron Throne, I hold my Grandsire's Valyrian dagger and I wield the Conqueror's sword."</p><p>"How did you...?"</p><p>Levana unsheathed her sword, displaying it to her mother and stepfather, "and I have the dragons of King Jahaerys and Queen Alysanne, if these are not symbols of legitimacy then I do not know what are."</p><p>"If you leave now, you will be breaking your ties with me as your mother," Rhaenyra stated, "you will no longer be a part of this family."</p><p>"You burned whatever bridge you had left with me the moment that your husband decided to take my children," Levana stated, <b>"I was never your daughter and I will never be."</b></p><p>"You were born from me and you are mine."</p><p>"You are my birth mother, yes, but I was never your daughter," Levana stated, "I wasn't your daughter with Ser Harwin and that's why I've lost your favor."</p><p>"Levana, I love you," Rhaenyra began to cry, "stop this at once, please."</p><p>"Save your tears for someone who cares," Levana stated, "from today, you can stop considering me as your daughter and I will no longer regard you as my mother, Queen Rhaenyra."</p><p>Vermithor spread its own wings as the other dragons began to shoot up to the sky, "I will see you on the battlefield."</p><p>With that, Vermithor took to the skies as well, joining Silverwing, Cannibal, and Grey Ghost. Rhaenyra watched as her daughter flew away; it was a majestic sight, really, seeing Levana fly with the dragons so near the Harvest Moon that it brought back memories.</p><p>But memories are meant to be forgotten and she was no longer Levana's mother.</p><p>They were enemies now. </p>

</p><p> </p><p>Flying with one dragon made Levana feel strong but flying with four?</p><p>
<b>She felt invincible.</b>
</p><p>The journey to Harrenhal was quick enough that they reached the fortress just before the crack of dawn. Ser Nandor waited outside the walls with Anam, Vad, and Maester Priamos - among them was a woman clad in black. </p><p>Levana landed her dragons just a few meters in front of them. Anam and Vad approached Vermithor and Silverwing but put distance between them and the two wild dragons - they would have to study the new dragons first before they could make attempts to approach them. </p><p><em>“We are glad that you made it safe and sound,”</em> Anam said as Levana unmounted from Vermithor, <em>“it seems that you succeeded.”</em> </p><p><em>“More than that,”</em> Levana responded, <em>“I now have the dragons of my great grandparents, that must mean something,”</em> she added before approaching Ser Nandor who had the widest smile on his face. </p><p>"Princess Levana, it pleases me and gives me relief that you arrived safely," Ser Nandor began, "please allow me to introduce Lady Nesrin of House Strong." </p><p>The female beside Ser Nandor took a step forward and removed her veil to reveal a woman who was around the same age as her mother; she had long brown hair and the same eyes as Ser Harwin — in fact, they looked alike. Levana bowed her head and smiled at the female, "thank you for welcoming my entourage with your kindness, Lady Nesrin." </p><p>The female shook her head, "it's the very least that I could do for you as someone who brought justice to the deaths suffered by my House." </p><p>“I am greatly sorry for your loss, Lady Nesrin,” Levana bowed her head slightly, “Lord Lyonel and Ser Harwin were very kind to me and they treated me like their kin.” </p><p>Nesrin smiled slightly and bowed her head as well, “now my father and brother can rest well in the heavens.” </p><p>“What do you intend to do with Lord Larys?” </p><p>“He is no longer a lord, he doesn’t deserve the title.” </p><p>Levana turned her head to see another female clad in black, from the look of it, she looked just a bit older than Nesrin but definitely not as old - though, there was an air about her that made the princess uneasy. </p><p>“Princess Levana, this is my sister and advisor,” Nesrin began, “Alys Rivers.” </p><p>“Rivers?” </p><p>“Just like your brothers, I too, am a bastard,” Alys chuckled, “though, I am the eldest of them all.” </p><p>“Apologies, Lady Alys,” Levana apologized, “I didn’t mean anything by it, I just haven’t encountered someone with your last name before.” </p><p>“I take no offense in it, princess,” Alys responded, “sometimes we ought to accept what we are, just as you have done by choosing to create your own faction in this war.” </p><p>“I haven’t decided on that yet.” </p><p>“But the fact that you are here means that you have.” </p><p>Nesrin chuckled, “please forgive my sister, she has abilities that are not known to man.” </p><p>“Just like Princess Levana,” Alys pointed out, “an incredible sense of hearing and the ability to control a plethora of dragons are abilities bestowed by the gods.” </p><p>Levana smiled as she turned to her dragons with a small smile, “I try my best,” she responded as Maester Priamos approached them hastily. He bowed to the princess, holding out a small scroll. </p><p>“We’ve been tracked, Your Grace,” Priamos stated, “we must leave for the Iron Island immediately.” </p><p>Levana took the scroll and read its contents. It was a letter from Aemond, detailing how the small council of King Aegon has decided to declare Levana as a traitor to the crown by leaving King’s Landing. Her husband also detailed how the king tried to defend the princess but it was to no avail and he lost the vote on the account of the missing Conqueror’s Sword and Jahaerys’ missing crown. It would only be a matter of time before the forces of the king reach Harrenhal which is where they suspect the princess to be. </p><p>“Galatea has sent troops from the Iron Islands,” Priamos reported, “but we must make haste, princess.” </p><p>“Lady Nesrin,” Levana sighed, “I do apologize that our meeting has been cut short but I will make sure that Harrenhal is protected at all costs.” </p><p>“House Strong is with you, <b>Queen</b> Levana,” Nesrin bowed her head as Alys did the same, “while it is yet to be your title, House Strong hopes to fight under your banner.” </p><p>Levana smiled slightly as she nodded, “once we reach the Iron Islands, I will send for you, Lady Nesrin.” </p><p>“We will be there,” Nesrin responded, “may the gods grant you safe passage, <b>My Queen</b>.” </p><p>While the title of “Queen” was not something Levana looked forward to having under the circumstance, she would have to figure it out once they reach the Iron Islands. As soon as Levana turned back, her entourage began to mount their horses while the princess mounted Vermithor. </p><p>“We need to reach the Iron Islands quicker and you cannot do it by horse,” Levana stated, she thought for a while as she looked around her. </p><p>“I may have an idea,” Nesrin began, “though, your dragons might find it to be unacceptable.” </p><p>“I’m willing to listen,” Levana stated. </p><p>“We have large cages in iron,” Nesrin said, “maybe your horses can board one while your entourage boards the other.” </p><p>“Your Grace,” Ser Nandor’s eyes widened, “you can’t be considering this can you?” </p><p>“Well,” Levana began, “it will help us reach our destination faster.” </p><p>“I’ll send for the cages,” Nesrin smiled widely as the gates of Harrenhal opened for her and Alys. The two ladies walked inside as Ser Nandor turned to the princess with a small pout, “Your Grace, I refuse to be caged like a dog.” </p><p>“Well, we don’t have other options,” Levana stated, “I’m partially sure that my dragons will not allow you to mount them and you would be dead within seconds if you tried.” </p><p>Ser Nandor frowned as he begrudgingly unmounted from his horse. Levana chuckled at the reaction as she turned to the three dragons that stood beside Vermithor with a small smile. </p><p>Her faction, no matter what it may be, looked off to a good start.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>The first thing that Rhaenyra did upon arriving at the castle was to summon her sons, Jacaerys and Joffrey. Her heart was thumping against her chest while she waited for her children. </p><p>She would have to break the news to them. </p><p>"Your Grace." </p><p>“Jacaerys,” Rhaenyra took a deep breath as her eldest son bowed his head slightly, the Queen smiled at him before walking around the table to greet his son, “where is Joffrey?” </p><p>“He was meant to follow me, Your Grace,” Jacaerys responded as the younger prince, as if on cue, pushed through the doors and into the room. He bowed his head to his mother and made his way to the side of his brother. </p><p>“You’re late, Joffrey,” Rhaenyra noted as the younger prince puffed his cheeks, “I apologize, Your Grace.” </p><p>Rhaenyra nodded before looking at her sons and sighing, "I have news about Levana.” </p><p>“Ana?” Jacaerys’s eyes widened, “has anything happened to her? Does she need our help?” </p><p>The older prince was making his way towards the doors, “I’ll take Vermax and fly to King’s Landing to retrieve my sister at once!” </p><p>“Jace,” Rhaenyra called. </p><p>“I knew Aemond wasn’t to be trusted with her,” Jacaerys swore under his breath, “command me, Your Grace and I will fly to King’s Landing imme-” </p><p>“Levana Velaryon is to no longer be considered your sister from this day,” Rhaenyra stated as the two princes looked at her with confused expressions.</p><p>“Mot-” Jacaerys shook his head, “Say again, Your Grace?” </p><p>"She was the one who managed to infiltrate Dragonstone,” Rhaenyra began, “due to unfortunate circumstances that started from the death of Lucerys, your sister had decided to remove herself from our family.” </p><p>“Therefore, Prince Jacaerys, whatever claim remains of me, you are now its heir,” Rhaenyra’s announcement made the two princes shrug. Jacaerys, being the closest in age to his older sister, knew how hard Levana had worked to make their mother proud.</p><p>To prove that she was a worthy heir to the Iron Throne. </p><p>Her place as heir wasn't something that she would’ve given up too easily - unless something grim had happened.</p><p>“What happened, Your Grace?” Jacaerys asked. </p><p>“There was a debt to be paid,” a voice from the door announced as Daemon walked into the room, “the debt collectors only claimed what was due,” he stated as Jacaerys looked at his younger brother who had begun to cry. </p><p>“Do not weep for her, Joffrey,” Daemon stated, “the whore made her choice when she decided to remain in Red Keep with her goblin of a husband.” </p><p>“You will not speak of Princess Levana as such, husband,” Rhaenyra stated, “she may no longer be my daughter but that gives you no right to sully her name in my court.” </p><p>“I want to hear the truth from my sister,” Jacaerys stated, “I will go and speak to her.” </p><p>“Leave the castle and you will no longer have one to return to, Prince Jacaerys,” Rhaenyra stated as the Prince looked at his mother. </p><p>Tears started to form in Jacaerys’ eyes as he spoke, “Levana was loyal to you, mother,” he stated, “whatever she did, she must’ve had a reason.” </p><p>“Unfortunately, we will never know what that reason might be,” Daemon stated as the prince stomped his way out of the room, Joffrey bowing to his parents before following suit. </p><p><em>“You see now the consequences of what has happened?”</em> Rhaenyra asked as Daemon simply chuckled. </p><p><em>“I’ll say it once and I will say it again,”</em> The rogue prince began, <em>“the moment that Levana developed love for Aemond Targaryen was the day that </em><em><b>we</b></em><em> lost her as a daughter.”</em> </p><p>Rhaenyra shook her head in disbelief, "she wasn't your daughter when she fell in love with Aemond," she looked into the fire, "I was still Laenor's wife then and she wasn't even four and ten when she fell in love." </p><p><b>“They struck the first blow, wife,”</b> Daemon reminded, <b>“and it was Levana’s husband who took your son.” </b></p><p>“The husband that I had arranged for her to marry,” Rhaenyra stated, “Laenor tried to stop me from getting into an arrangement with Alicent but I insisted," the Queen recalled fondly. </p><p>“Ana was always kind even to Aegon,” The Black Queen reminisced, “unlike her brothers, Levana was always the one with an open heart,” she stated as she looked over the large map in front of her.</p><p>Daemon looked at his wife with a smirk, "Levana was too kind."</p><p>“Maybe that is the reason why she found the heart to forgive and love Aemond,” Rhaenyra sighed, “my father always doted on her for that.” </p><p>“Levana was a delight,” Daemon admitted, “it’s no wonder that Ser Laenor and Ser Harwin doted on her as well.” </p><p>“Princess Rhaenys will also have to learn about this,” Rhaenyra stated, “I cannot imagine how she would feel when Levana is the only testament left of Laenor,” she continued as Daemon shook his head - he was numb to such things.</p><p>“For one,” Daemon began, “Princess Rhaenys would have expected this as Levana did reject her during Aegon’s coronation.”</p><p>“I mourn the loss of Lucerys,” Rhaenyra sighed, “but I also mourn the loss of my daughter.” </p><p>“Rhaenyra,” Daemon began, “there is nothing else that we can do about this.” </p><p>The Black Queen turned away from her husband and took a deep breath before calling for Ser Erryk. The knight had come quickly through the door and bowed his head to the Queen, “how can I be of service to you, Your Grace?” </p><p>“Assemble my council,” Rhaenyra ordered, “I am to make an announcement regarding my succession.” </p><p>Ser Erryk bowed once more before leaving the room. </p><p>The mother and daughter already made their choice and it was only a matter of time before Levana would have to stand up for hers.</p>

<p>Levana and her entourage arrived at Pyke just as the sun began to rise. They flew nonstop from Harrenhal to the Iron Islands just so they could be out of harm's way by morning. It was an easy journey - especially on dragonback.</p><p>The princess rode on Vermithor while Cannibal, being one of her largest, carried the cage with horses, and Grey Ghost was left to carry the cage that contained her entourage. Levana couldn't help but chuckle in amusement as he watched Ser Nandor panic as they took to the sky - not everyone was born with the urge to be among the clouds, it seems.</p><p>Just as they were about to land, they were greeted by the sight of Galatea on Seasmoke. Just seeing both of them gave Levana relief as they finally landed. As soon as the princess unmounted from her dragon, Galatea rushed to her with an embrace; the former handmaiden, now a Lady of House Greyjoy, cried as the princess returned her embrace.</p><p>"I'm so sorry, My Lady," Galatea sobbed, "I wasn't there when Princess Aemma and Prince Baelon were--"</p><p>"Galatea, it's alright," Levana assured, "what matters most to me is that you are safe and that you have reunited with Lord Besian."</p><p>Lady Galatea broke the embrace as Seasmoke shrilled in delight. Levana approached the dragon, her hand outstretched as Seasmoke bumped his snout against her hand; a feeling of nostalgia enveloped the princess as she stroked the dragon's neck.</p><p>"I missed you so much," Levana whispered, placing her forehead against Seasmoke's snout, "I trust Galatea has been treating you well."</p><p>"The dragon has been spoiled, Your Grace."</p><p>A tall man appeared from behind Seasmoke Galatea rolled her eyes. They shared the same features but what stood out the most were their violet eyes - similar to what her family has. They were dragonseeds, after all.</p><p>"Princess Levana," Galatea began as she approached the male, "please allow me to introduce my older brother, King Besian of House Greyjoy."</p><p>"Princess," King Besian bowed deeply, "there are no words that will allow me to express my thanks to you after what you have done for my sister."</p><p>"You need not thank me, King Besian," Levana smiled, "I owe much to Galatea for standing strong by my side through thick and thin."</p><p>King Besian bowed his head again before looking at the entourage behind the princess with a chuckle, "they traveled in style, I see."</p><p>"We didn't have a choice," Ser Nandor responded, "they were being tracked and it was only a matter of time before King Aegon's troops reached Harrenhal and captured the princess."</p><p>"King Besian," Levana stepped aside, "this is Ser Nandor my sworn sword, and with us are Maester Priamos and my dragonkeepers, Anam and Vad."</p><p>King Besian smiled at them, "House Greyjoy originally swore to Princess Rhaenyra but as I am the High King now, I will take our banners and fight under yours, Princess Levana Velaryon."</p><p>There was a slight pause as Levana looked at the ground, she was still so unsure of what to do at this point - especially with the fielty of two Great Houses. She wasn't certain if she wanted to start a war against her mother and uncle but she also knew that she couldn't let them continue fighting.</p><p>It would break the realm that her grandsires had worked so hard to build and maintain.</p><p>"King Besian," Levana took a deep breath, "I have nothing to offer you for your loyalty and your banners, I am nothing without my mother and I will not be able to repay what you give me."</p><p>Galatea smiled and looked at her older brother who knelt in front of Levana.</p><p><b>"Your Grace,"</b> Galatea knelt beside her brother, <b>"it was never about what you had but what you are willing to do."</b></p><p>"I..." Levana trailed off, "I cannot ask you to risk your lives for a cause that we don't even know will succeed."</p><p><b>"You need not ask for it,"</b> King Besian looked up at the princess,<b> "because I am giving it of my own free will and so are the other Lords of our House."</b></p><p>As King Besian spoke, a group of people began to advance toward them from the castle. Levana took a deep breath as she watched, she was overwhelmed by the action that brought her to tears.</p><p>"House Greyjoy's sworn houses are yours to command, Levana Velaryon," King Besian stated, "what we do is of our own will, and repayment is not required for our service to your cause."</p><p>Levana looked around her; those around her slowly began to bend the knee to her - a princess - she didn't have the same title as her mother or Aegon and she didn't know what she was about to do nor know what she was getting herself into but King Viserys entrusted her with a mission to find peace.</p><p>That was something that she was determined to achieve.</p><p>"If I am to be Queen," Levana began, "I would like to be crowned here in the Iron Islands and in front of those who will be supporting me."</p><p>"The Triarchy is on its way and so is Prince Sorin from Dorne," Ser Nandor stated proudly.</p><p>"The Triarchy?" Levana raised a brow, "we managed to acquire the support of The Triarchy?"</p><p>Galatea stood up and nodded, "with the acquiescence of Prince Sorin, we were able to have a discussion with Airell Drahar," she explained, "though, she requests to have an audience with you, Your Grace, before The Triarchy can fully commit to you."</p><p>"The Crabfeeder's sister?" Levana asked, "why would she want to help me when my stepfather and grandsire championed against them at the Stepstones?"</p><p>"Because you are not Corlys Velaryon or Daemon Targaryen," Besian responded, "you are your own person, and the fact that you have decided to champion against the impending war has forced us to choose sides."</p><p>"Princess," Galatea began, "we also have someone who wants to support the cause as a member of your Queensguard."</p><p>"A Queensguard already?" Levana chuckled, "I haven't even been crowned yet."</p><p>"Queen Levana Velaryon."</p><p>Levana's eyes widened as she turned around, tears immediately falling from her eyes as she saw Ser Harrold standing by Ser Nandor. The two knights bent their knees and held up their swords, offering them to Levana:</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>I swear to ward the Queen with all my strength and give my blood for hers.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall guard her secrets, obey her commands, ride at her side, and defend her name and her honor.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Levana rushed towards Ser Harrold, embracing him as she cried, "old friend, I thought you had died."</p><p>"I swore that I would serve you again, Your Grace," Ser Harold responded, "I intend to do good on that promise."</p><p>With this number of people by Levana's side, everything was coming into place - all that was left was to crown the Queen.</p><p>
<b>The Golden Queen.</b>

<p>"What I want to know is why there were troops from House Greyjoy in Harrenhal!"</p><p>Aemond leaned back against his seat as the members of his brother's small council scrambled to try to come up with an explanation. The younger prince smiled to himself as even his grandsire, the Hand, had no explanation for what was happening.</p><p>"First Eva and now this," Aegon ranted, "someone better come up with an explanation for this or I will take it upon myself to find answers."</p><p>It was only a matter of time before Aemond would escape from the capital to join his wife wherever she was. He knew that Levana was headed west but where specifically; he was not so sure. Nonetheless, he would take Vhagar and fly in that direction — he was going to do everything in his power to join Levana.</p><p>"What say you, brother?" Aegon asked, "do you have any input on this?"</p><p>"It could be that you have a mole in your council," Aemond began, "how else would they be prepared to defend Harrenhal if there were no moles?"</p><p>"A bold accusation," The Hand remarked, "a heavy one at that."</p><p>"One that I intend to bring up," Aemond crossed his legs, "do you believe upon yourselves that this all happened without a mole, hm?"</p><p>"I suppose the most likely suspect would be you," Aegon pointed out, "you are still Levana's husband and we all know that even if I am to see you in the seven hells, you would still be in love with her."</p><p>"Well, my wife does condemn me for causing the death of our children," Aemond laughed, "it's likely that you'll see me in the seven hells very soon."</p><p>Aegon chuckled, "I will see to it that the Gullet and nearby areas are secured," he stated before standing up, "you would do well to figure out how my wife escaped from King's Landing otherwise you might lose another dragonrider."</p><p>"Aemond," Alicent spoke up, "what do you mean?"</p><p>"If my wife isn't found, I intend to find her," Aemond said blankly, "I will not remain here and be used as your pawn while my <b>pregnant </b>wife is nowhere to be found."</p><p>Alicent looked at him in shock. She, in the midst of the chaos, had forgotten that her daughter-in-law was with child. This was enough to trigger the alarms in her head - more than anything, she was worried; but also, she didn't know what The Hand and her son would do if they found Levana.</p><p>"Let Aemond take charge of patrolling the air, Aegon," Alicent affirmed, "he is our most skilled dragonrider and the best one at that."</p><p>Aegon glared.</p><p>"What news of the other areas?" The Targaryen King asked, "we've been sitting here like ducks while Rhaenyra is steadily growing and now we have a threat from the Ironborn."</p><p>"We're trying our best, Your Grace," Otto responded, "but the Blacks are just as convincing as we are."</p><p>"Maybe you aren't convincing enough, Grandsire," Aegon replied, "we have troops being sent out, and for what?"</p><p>"Aegon," Alicent looked at her son, "don't."</p><p>"What?" Aegon asked, "Grandsire has chosen to delay combat to secure alliances, did he not? Well, it's cost us a number of troops."</p><p>"We haven't received replies from most of them, Your Grace," Otto defended, "we are trying our best to secure what we can for the benefit of the crown."</p><p>"You haven't even secured The Reach," Aemond pointed out, "based on what I have gathered, you've only received correspondence from House Hightower and House Redwyne, the rest swore to Rhaenyra."</p><p>"Apart from that, House Martell and Dorne remain neutral," Aegon continued as Criston Cole stepped forward, "there has been development with Dorne, Your Grace."</p><p>"What development?" Aegon raised a brow.</p><p>"Dorne and House Martell did not declare for you or Rhaenyra but they were sighted off the port of Lannisport," Criston reported, "it seems that they were headed towards the Iron Islands."</p><p>"Is there a faction there that I am not aware of?"</p><p>"We cannot say for sure, Your Grace," Otto responded, "at least not yet."</p><p>"What about the Triarchy?" Aegon inquired, "did you not send correspondence to them as well?"</p><p>"Airell Drahar and her entourage are also on their way to the Iron Islands," Criston reported, "there is a chance that they might not declare for King Aegon."</p><p>"Send someone to the Iron Islands," Aegon commanded, "if none of you has thought of sending someone there yet, this better be done now."</p><p>Criston nodded his head and headed out of the room, meanwhile, Aemond looked at his family in disarray - he had a clue why they might be headed to the Iron Island as that was west of King's Landing.</p><p>His wife was due west.</p><p>"When Cole comes back," Aegon began, "tell him that he is to be Hand of the King from now on."</p><p>Otto stood up from his seat in shock, "I have served this family and I will remain as your Hand until this war is over!"</p><p>"You've proven to be inefficient, Grandsire," Aegon replied, "you failed to secure the support of Dorne, The Reach, the Triarchy, and the Iron Islands. How are we to win this war if you keep on stalling combat?"</p><p>"Think twice about this, Aegon," Alicent pleaded.</p><p>"No," The King responded bluntly, "Otto Hightower will be replaced by Criston Cole and if I do not have news as to what is going on in the Iron Islands in the next few days, someone's head will roll."</p><p>Aemond watched and chuckled to himself, "let me go to the Iron Islands to discover what's happening."</p><p>"You will stay here and guard the front against the Blacks," Aegon hissed, "someone else is going to the Iron Islands."</p><p>"I'll be faster."</p><p>"I need capable people in this council, Aemond," Aegon stated, "I am not about to lose another one if you left."</p><p>Aemond looked at his brother with a glare, "I'm trying to help."</p><p>"You'll be of better help if you stayed in King's Landing," Aegon responded, "and that's an order from the king."<br/><br/></p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>Levana stood by the window of her room, it's been a few days since she settled in Pyke; the beauty of the ocean reminded her of <b>home</b> - or at least, her father's home of Driftmark. The memories jogged her mind now and then but it was an appreciated distraction; she didn't want to see more of her visions - not now, at least.</p><p>Her visions have started to become more vivid. Most of the time, the visions would remain in her dreams but even in her waking life, they began to haunt her as well.</p><p>She would sometimes see phantom figures in the room and hear phantom voices - ones that she would recognize as Lucerys and her other brothers. She would often think about Jacaerys and Joffrey, she wonders what her mother told them about her detachment from the family.</p><p>Levana knew that Jacaerys would take it for the worse. They were the closest, after all.</p><p>Her train of thought was disturbed by a knock on the door, "come in," the princess called as Galatea walked inside with a tray of tea in her hands.</p><p>"To help ease your mind, Your Grace," Galatea smiled as she placed the tray on the coffee table as Levana approached her.</p><p>"You need not serve me," Levana stated, "you are a lady here and you are no longer my handmaiden."</p><p>"When you were much younger, I made a vow to serve you for as long as you lived," Galatea responded, "I would like to make good on that vow just as Ser Harrold intends to make good on his."</p><p>"Galatea, why are you doing this?"</p><p>The question caught the older female off-guard but she chuckled, nonetheless.</p><p>"Because I believe that you are the only one capable of bringing your family together," Galatea responded, "you've done it in the past and I'm very sure that you can do it again."</p><p>"We are in the middle of a war, Galatea."</p><p>"The Targaryens have always been at war, Your Grace," Galatea responded, "but you managed to bring them together."</p><p>"Are you not a Targaryen as well?"</p><p>"I am more related to you than you know, Your Grace," Galatea responded, "King Besian and I are Velaryon dragonseeds."</p><p>Levana's eyes widened, "my Grandsire--"</p><p>"I am not pointing fingers, Your Grace," Galatea smiled slightly, "it would be better off for all of us if we did not know who my real father was."</p><p>"Galatea, do you think your brother could command a dragon?" Levana asked as Galatea looked at her with a puzzled expression, "you would give him a dragon, Your Grace?"</p><p>"Grey Ghost or Silverwing would make a great pair for King Besian," Levana thought for a while, "but I do intend on keeping Silverwing as she once belonged to Queen Alysanne."</p><p>"How did you manage to claim the dragons, Your Grace?"</p><p>"If I'm being honest with you, Galatea, I've no clue as well," Levana responded, "maybe it was the magic of the Harvest Moon."</p><p>"It must be," Galatea responded, "you've always had an affinity with the Harvest Moon."</p><p>Levana smiled to herself, "what news of Prince Sorin and the Triarchy?"</p><p>"They should be here in a day or two," Galatea reported, "Lady Nesrin and Alys Rivers are also on their way."</p><p>The princess thought for a while, "do you think Alys can help me find the bastards who took my children from me?"</p><p>The other female took a deep breath and held Levana's hand tightly, "I wouldn't expect too much, Your Grace," she sighed, "but I will also do my part in trying to find who did it."</p><p>Levana smiled, "thank you, Galatea."</p><p>"You're always welcome, My Queen."</p>

<p>"Your Grace, an emissary from the Triarchy has arrived."</p><p>Levana turned to Ser Nandor as the knight bowed his head. It's been a few days since she's come to the Iron Islands and everything seemed to be going as planned. Lady Nesrin and her sister, Alys, arrived just before daybreak. They brought news that Lord Otto was removed from his post as Hand of the King and was replaced by Ser Criston Cole.</p><p>The news shocked Levana and somehow, it made her blood run cold. She always believed that, despite his tendencies, Lord Otto was still the lesser evil between the two.</p><p>"Airell Drahar is waiting with Lady Galatea and King Besian in the Great Hall," Ser Nandor stated, "they are requesting your presence."</p><p>Levana nodded before standing up from her seat, she placed a hand on her stomach before making her way out the door. Ser Nandor followed closely behind her as Ser Harrold met them just outside the doors of the Great Hall.</p><p>"Are you sure you are fit to fight a war, Your Grace?" Ser Harrold chuckled, "I worry that the child might want to participate in it."</p><p>Levana smiled a response, "a mother is much stronger when she has children to protect, Ser Harrold."</p><p>The knight looked at her with a worried smile before nodding, "Lady Nesrin is inside as well."</p><p>"Have you news of Aemond?"</p><p>Ser Harrold shook her head, "the only news to come out of King's Landing is the execution of the Lords and Ladies who refused to bend the knee to King Aegon."</p><p>"Do we have names?"</p><p>"Those slain are Lady Fell and Lords Hayford, Merryweather, Harte, Buckler, and Caswell," Ser Harrold reported, "those who bent the knee are Lords Rosby, Stokeworth, and Butterwell."</p><p>Levana sighed as she dusted off her dress before facing the door, "we shouldn't even have to choose sides," she mumbled as Ser Nandor pushed the doors open.</p><p>"Princess Levana Velaryon of House Targaryen," Ser Harrold announced as those seated by the Painted Table stood to greet the princess. Levana bowed her head in acknowledgment as she turned to the new figure seated at the other end of the table.</p><p>"Airell Drahar," Levana bowed again, "you honor me by traveling through the Narrow Sea."</p><p>"I was getting disturbed by King Aegon and his party," Airell responded as she leaned back against her chair, "I did not want to be disturbed further so I accepted King Besian's invitation to travel here and meet the Queen who is supposed to end this war."</p><p>"I'm flattered."</p><p>"Though, I did not expect the said Queen to be pregnant," Airell pursed her lips, "how do you propose to fight?"</p><p>"I'm a capable dragonrider," Levana stated, "I have four dragons."</p><p>"Ah, yes," Airell chuckled, "the smallfolk of the Iron Islands have decided to call you the <b>Mother of Dragons</b> for achieving such a feat."</p><p>Levana chuckled, "I wouldn't call myself that."</p><p>"Is this your first?"</p><p>Levana shook her head, "no."</p><p>Galatea looked at the princess and then back at the Airell, "we do not speak of the princess' other children."</p><p>Levana raised her hand, "they were murdered," she stated, "by the Rogue Prince."</p><p>Airell chuckled, "that man seems to have a knack for murder and now, he's a kinslayer."</p><p>"He took away your brother too, am I right?"</p><p>"It wasn't just him," Airell raised a brow, "your Grandsire played a part in it too."</p><p>"And for that, I deeply apologize," Levana bowed her head, "my Grandsire did not think good of the Triarchy."</p><p>Airell smiled, "that he did."</p><p>"Why did you come?" Levana asked, "you could have accepted King Aegon's offer when he clearly has the upper hand in this war."</p><p>"Did you want to participate initially, princess?" Airell asked as Levana shook her head.</p><p>"Did you choose a side?"</p><p>"I didn't," Levana responded, "that's why I'm here."</p><p>"Are you participating in this war on your own accord?"</p><p>"Stop quizzing the princess--"</p><p>"Yes, Airell Drahar," Levana responded, "I am participating in this war of my own will and even if I am driven by the wishes of my Grandsire, King Viserys, he did not force me to choose this path."</p><p>Airell kept silent as Levana took a deep breath.</p><p>"I chose to travel to the Iron Islands and to accept that I am a part of this war no matter what," Levana sighed, "I was not forced by anything or anyone to choose this side."</p><p>"Are you fighting for revenge?"</p><p>"I am fighting for the realm."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because a Queen belongs not to herself but to the realm," Levana stated firmly, "I want this war to end because all it's done is bring pain and ruin to people who don't even want to be involved in it."</p><p>Airell chuckled and stood up, "that's all I needed to hear," she stated before unsheathing her sword and placing it on the table.</p><p>"The Triarchy will fight with you."</p><p>King Besian looked at his sister in awe, "that quick?"</p><p>"It's clear to me that Princess Levana's intentions are good," Airell said, "she is fighting for the realm and not for the Iron Throne."</p><p>Levana smiled slightly, "I am indebted to you, Airell Drahar."</p><p>"Your debt will be paid once you win this war and sit on the throne," Airell responded as the doors to the Grand Hall opened to reveal Grand Maester Priamos who hastily approached the princess.</p><p>"The Greens are attacking Rook's Rest, Your Grace," Priamos stated, "your grandmother is defending them."</p><p>Levana's eyes widened, "and the dragons?"</p><p>"Sunfyre and..."</p><p>Levana didn't need to hear more. She rushed out of the room and headed immediately toward one of the towers; Vermithor immediately arrived at his rider's aid. Without much of a second thought, Levana climbed the edge and jumped on her saddle, barely sitting herself down as the Bronze Fury began to fly.</p><p>"Cannibal! Silverwing!" Levana called, <em>"fly to me!"</em></p><p>Loud roars resounded through the heavens as Cannibal and Silverwing flew beside Vermithor.</p><p><em>"We need to hurry," </em>Levana stated, <em>"my grandmother needs us."</em></p><p>Vermithor roared mightily as he began to pick up the pace; Silverwing and Cannibal following after them.</p><p>Once again, the princess was in a race against time.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p> </p><p>"My Queen," Ser Erryk approached Rhaenyra in haste with a scroll in her hand, "Lord Staunton requests for help."</p><p>"What happened to Rook's Rest?" Rhaenyra asked as the knight handed the scroll to her, "the Greens came to attack and Lord Staunton requests our assistance."</p><p>The Black Queen thought for a while, Daemon was on his way to Harrenhal by land at the moment. Jacaerys hasn't come back from Winterfell; she debated for a while if she should go before Princess Rhaenys stepped forward.</p><p>"I'll go," Rhaenys volunteered, "they need you here, Queen Rhaenyra."</p><p>The Black Queen nodded as Rhaenys made her way out of the palace only to be stopped by Joffrey who was waiting for her by the door.</p><p>"Grandmother?" Joffrey looked up at her, "will you fight?"</p><p>Rhaenys looked at her grandson with a knowing smile and nodded, "it is inevitable, Joff."</p><p>"Can I ask you for something?"</p><p>The Queen Who Never Was knelt in front of the young prince and placed a hand on his shoulder, "if it is in my power, I will have it done, Joffrey."</p><p>"Please bring Ana home," Joffrey looked at the ground, "I'm scared and I miss Ana."</p><p>Rhaenys wrapped her arms around her grandson, embracing him tightly as the prince did the same.</p><p>"I will try to bring Ana back," Rhaenys promised, "for now, take charge as your older brother has to return," she smiled as she broke the embrace. Joffrey nodded with a smile before running away from the doors of the Great Hall.</p><p>Rhaenys watched as her grandson disappeared into the halls. If things were to go sideways, this would be the last time that she's seen her grandson or any of her grandchildren at that.</p><p>She could only hope that she would be able to see Levana one last time.</p>

<p>Rhaenys Targaryen was always considered to be a valiant woman.</p><p>The Queen Who Never Was proudly served her realm and did so with much pride. That’s why she didn’t think twice to fly to the Rook’s Rest to stand in their defense against the Greens. </p><p>Upon her arrival on Meleys, she delivered a mighty display of flames - burning down the troops on the ground. The arrows being sent toward them proved to be of no use and only angered the Red Queen further. </p><p>Scorpions and arrows made their attempt to injure Meleys but the Red Queen retaliated with flames - burning troops and their shields. </p><p>“Aim for the rider!” </p><p>Rhaenys turned towards a knight on his white stallion, which she recognized as Criston Cole. Meleys continued to rain fire on the troops; it seemed victory was on her side. </p><p>That is until two loud roars resounded through the sky. </p><p>Rhaenys cursed under her breath as Sunfyre and Vhagar flew toward them, she tried her best to fight them, breathing fire at the two dragons but they retaliated with their own flames. Rhaenys had to think fast because, at this rate, she would not be able to defeat both dragons - not when Vhagar was larger than her own. </p><p>“How does it feel to betray the crown, Princess Rhaenys?” Aegon taunted, “all this because you couldn’t secure the crown yourself?” </p><p>“This is beyond my ambition for the crown!” Rhaenys shouted, “this is for the realm!” </p><p>Meleys ascended higher into the sky as she released a large flame, almost engulfing Sunfyre in it but the golden dragon evaded - narrowly escaping the flames.</p><p>“The realm will thank you for nothing,” Aegon laughed as Sunfyre pursued Meleys. Rhaenys navigated through the skies, making sure that she was away from the jaws of either Vhagar or Sunfyre. </p><p>“Say, Princess Rhaenys,” Aegon spoke loudly, “you wouldn’t happen to know what came of Levana, do you?” </p><p>The mention of the name made Rhaenys’ heart drop. What happened to her beloved granddaughter? </p><p>“Where is she?” </p><p>“I was hoping that you’d tell us,” Aemond responded as Vhagar roared, “where is my wife?!” </p><p>Rhaenys couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Her granddaughter wasn’t in King’s Landing anymore and she wasn’t with the Greens. </p><p>The moment that she got distracted, Aegon took it as an opportunity to attack; breathing fire at Meleys as Aemond disappeared, hiding while trying to find his own timing to attack. When Meleys began to fight back again, she managed to sink her teeth into Sunfyre’s neck, injuring the dragon. </p><p>Aemond’s eyes widened as the dragon began its descent. Immediately, the one-eyed prince commanded his dragon to attack the Red Queen. He was almost successful in his attempt to attack the dragon but he was stopped when a black dragon attacked Vhagar, pushing her away from the collision. </p><p>The dragon disappeared as quickly as it came and all Aemond could see was the shadow of two other dragons approaching his brother. He smiled slightly at the sight of Vermithor, staying in the clouds as the Bronze Fury attacked Sunfyre with his flames. </p><p>Rhaenys, on the other hand, couldn’t believe her eyes as she saw Levana. Her heart swelled with relief as Sunfyre managed to break free from Meleys’ grasp, managing to attack the female dragon by sinking his teeth into her neck as well. </p><p>“Grandma!” Levana shouted as Cannibal and Silverwing pushed Sunfyre aside, charging at him. Meleys was too weak to fight and so she began her descent, fortunately, Levana was quick enough to retrieve her grandmother from her dragon before she fell to the ground. Vermithor held Princess Rhaenys in his claws carefully as the princess watched her two dragons deal their final blows to Sunfyre. </p><p>Cannibal, being the largest among the three, was able to rip apart one of Sunfyre’s wings while Silverwing breathed fire towards him. Aemond watched in pity before charging towards one of the dragons - an act to show that he was still on his brother’s side but it was to no avail.</p><p>Sunfyre the Golden descended to the ground in flames and all Levana could hear were Aegon’s screams. </p><p>“Fall back to me!” Levana commanded as Vermithor began to fly west with Cannibal and Silverwing following after him. </p><p>The princess turned her head to see her husband just a few feet away from them. She smiled at him, “come to the Iron Islands,” she stated before her dragons flew away; leaving Vhagar and Aemond behind. </p><p>At the very least, he knew where to find her now. </p><p align="center"><br/>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p><br/>Vermithor carefully let go of Rhaenys as he flew above one of the towers at Pyke. The Queen Who Never Was sustained a few injuries that she sustained were great but they did leave her with gashes across her arms and legs. </p><p>Levana carefully unmounted from Vermithor, her hands shaking as she held onto one of the posts at the tower. The Bronze Fury looked at his rider with a soft expression; Levana noticed this and placed a hand on its snout before smiling, “go on, take a rest.” </p><p>Vermithor grumbled as he flew off to one of the vacant islands just near Pyke; it was where he resided with Cannibal, Silverwing, and Grey Ghost as the Iron Islands didn’t have proper accommodations for dragons - let alone four large ones. </p><p>Ser Nandor helped Levana walk towards her grandmother who immediately ran up to her and embraced her tightly.</p><p>“I thought we had lost you,” Rhaenys began to cry, “why did you not stay in Dragonstone when you claimed the dragons?” </p><p>“What did my mother tell you?” </p><p>“Nothing,” Princess Rhaenys responded, “Joffrey asked me to bring you home before I left for Rook’s Rest but we were told nothing.” </p><p>Levana felt her blood boil.</p><p>Her mother didn’t tell anyone the truth of what happened during the night that she was in Dragonstone. No one knew what occurred and it was clear to her that no one knew what became of her children.</p><p>“Did you take Baelon and Aemma with you?” </p><p>Levana dreaded that question.</p><p>Ser Nandor felt the uneasiness of the princess and looked at Maester Priamos, “Princess Rhaenys, if I may, you should allow the maesters to treat your wounds before they get any worse.” </p><p>Rhaenys raised a brow but noticed the look on Levana’s face as well; it was a mixture of anger and longing. She relented and embraced her granddaughter one more time before heading into the castle with the Maester. </p><p>“She needs to know the truth,” Levana mumbled, “she loved her grandchildren.” </p><p>Ser Nandor walked ahead of the princess, “you should rest as well, Your Grace,” he stated as Levana placed a hand on her stomach, “wouldn’t want the babe to come early.” </p><p>“At this rate,” Levana chuckled, “I would rather that the babe did come early as it wouldn’t be proper for me to be riding dragons and fighting in a war while I’m pregnant.” </p><p>Ser Nandor smiled slightly, “is Prince Aemond joining us anytime soon?” </p><p>Levana shook her head, “I doubt,” she sighed, “Aegon needs him more than ever now.” </p><p>“Will you have to fight him?” </p><p>“Ser Nandor,” Levana looked at her stomach, “the better question is, will he fight me?” </p>

<p>Aegon, for the lack of the better term, was better off dead. </p><p>The condition that they managed to recover him in was at the very endpoint of bad. Not only did he suffer numerous burns but he also sustained injuries from the attacks of Cannibal, Silverwing, and Meleys. </p><p>The maesters called it a miracle that he still survived.</p><p>“He will no longer be able to fight Rhaenyra,” Otto stated as Aemond leaned back against his seat, watching the fire. Alicent looked at her father and then at the prince, “you are second in line to the throne, Aemond.” </p><p>“I will not take the crown from him,” Aemond responded, “I no longer plan to fight for this cause.” </p><p>“Is it because of Eva?” Alicent asked, “Eva was there, wasn’t she?” </p><p>“As beautiful as the day that I first saw her,” Aemond laughed, “I am not going to war with my own wife, the mother of my children.” </p><p>“What about the deaths of Baelon and Aemma?” Otto asked, “do you not intend to fight for your children?” </p><p>“My children died because of this war!” Aemond stood up from his chair, “I lost my wife once because of this war and I do not intend to lose her forever.” </p><p>“We need you, Aemond,” Alicent pleaded, “who else will fight for the crown?” </p><p>“Mother, I don’t know if you’ve noticed but we are on the losing end in terms of dragons and troops,” Aemond stated, “Sunfyre is dead while Rhaenyra and my wife have five each.” </p><p>“There were only three with Levana,” Otto glared.</p><p>“You do not listen to your own reports,” the prince pointed out, “Seasmoke was last spotted heading west and the three wild dragons were spotted above the Riverlands, were they not?” </p><p>“You think Levana is in the Iron Islands?” Alicent asked.</p><p>“I don’t think,” Aemond chuckled, “I know.” </p><p>“Then what are you waiting for?” Otto asked, “go to Levana and secure a pact with her to fight against Rhaenyra.”</p><p>“If I am to fight in this war, I’m going to fight for the right cause,” Aemond responded, “not some Hightower usurpers whose ambitions went above their heads.”</p><p>“Your father, King Viserys, wished for Aegon to take the throne,” Alicent defended, “he said so on his deathbed.” </p><p>“Levana was with my father on his deathbed,” Aemond stated, “she was summoned by my father the night that he died.” </p><p>Alicent’s eyes widened, “what…?” </p><p>“You have all of us fighting for you under a lie,” the prince stated confidently, “Levana and I were in the library when Cole came for Levana to bring him my father.” </p><p>Alicent was speechless. She had been found out.</p><p>“The last person to be with King Viserys was Levana,” Aemond said, “if there is a rightful heir to the throne, it’s her.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p><br/>Levana sat by her grandmother’s bed, waiting for her to awaken. </p><p>The maesters reported that Princess Rhaenys would survive her injuries and would be fine in a few weeks time. This relieved Levana as her grandmother was going to be okay but what worried her was going to be the reaction that Rhaenys would have to the news that she was about to tell.<br/> <br/>“What happened to Baelon and Aemma?” </p><p>Levana turned to Rhaenys who smiled at her, “you seem worried,” the older princess stated as the former looked at her lap.</p><p>“I had hoped that you wouldn’t wake up too soon, grandma,” Levana sighed, “I haven’t had the time to properly think.” </p><p>“They aren’t with you, are they?” Rhaenys asked, “are they with their father at least?” </p><p>Levana pursed her lips, “they’re with my Grandsire, King Viserys, now.” </p><p>Rhaenys sat up slowly with a confused expression upon her face, “Ana? What do you mean?” </p><p>“A few nights after Lucerys died,” Levana began to tear up, “Baelon and Aemma were…” </p><p>The older princess reached for her granddaughter’s hand and held it tightly, “who did it?” <br/>“It was Daemon,” Levana revealed, “he sent assassins to murder them and I had to watch them die.” </p><p>“They never told us,” Rhaenys muttered, “your mother only announced that Jacaerys would be her heir but nothing more after.” </p><p>Levana chuckled slightly. Of course, her younger brother would have to carry that burden now.” </p><p>“I thought you died,” Rhaenys stated, “I thought something happened to you and your mother was keeping all of us in the dark.” </p><p>“She’s not my mother anymore,” Levana said spitefully, “whatever we had left burned down when my children were taken away from me.” </p><p>Rhaenys, of course, understood where her granddaughter was coming from. She knew how much Levana and Aemond, for that matter, loved their children. Aemma and Baelon were everything to them.</p><p>“Grandmother, I will not keep you here,” Levana looked at Rhaenys, “if you wish to return to Dragonstone, I will arrange for it.” </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“I do not want to keep you here if you do not want it,” Levana stated, “I do not want to force you to stay and I do not want you to feel as though you don’t have a choice but to do so.” </p><p>“You would allow me to go back?” </p><p>Levana nodded, “I feel as though this war has left most without a choice and I want to give people a choice.” </p><p>Rhaenys smiled nostalgically at her granddaughter, “I feel as though, after so many years, I saw your father.” </p><p>The princess nodded as transferred to sit on the bed just beside her grandmother, “if you are to stay, grandmother, I would be honored if you were to crown me at my coronation.”</p><p>“I’m not a member of your Queensguard,” Rhaenys pointed out, “I do not have that kind of power.” </p><p>“But you are Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,” Levana stated, “I would be honored if the Queen Who Never Was crowned the Queen who would save this realm.” </p><p>Princess Rhaenys wrapped her arms around her granddaughter tightly. Levana couldn’t help but cry as she embraced her grandmother - she’s longed for a familiar touch ever since she left King’s Landing and she was more than happy that her grandmother was by her side now. </p><p>All that’s left was for Aemond to join them and Levana would finally have a sense of being complete - a feeling that she yearned for.</p><p>“Your Grace.” </p><p>Levana turned to the door, “enter, Ser Nandor.”</p><p>“You have to come and see this,” Ser Nandor stated, “there’s a ship spotted just off the coast and a boat has been released from it.”</p><p>“Any banners?” </p><p>Ser Nandor shook his head, “but they are on their way and Airell wants to know if you want to shoot it down.” </p><p>Levana stood up from the bed and shook her head, “whoever they are, they must be here for a reason.”</p><p>The knight nodded, “this way, Your Grace.” </p><p>“I’ll be back, grandmother,” Levana smiled, “I will send Maester Priamos to keep you company and bring you up to speed on what our plans will be.” </p><p>Rhaenys smiled to herself as Levana walked towards the door, “Ana?” </p><p>“Yes, grandmother?”</p><p>

<p>Ser Nandor escorted Levana as they made their way to Pyke’s coast, Airell stood there alongside Galatea and Nesrin - the three females watching the small boat as it continued its approach. </p><p>“It looks like a ship from Essos,” Airell stated, “but not one of mine.” </p><p>“My troops have already arrived,” Nesrin stated, “and they arrived by land.” </p><p>“What of Dorne, Ser Nandor?” Levana asked, “any news?” </p><p>“They were delayed by Lannisport,” Ser Nandor reported, “they won’t be here until tomorrow or the day after.”</p><p>When the small boat arrived at the pier, they were immediately met by Ser Nandor and Ser Harrold, their swords drawn as two hooded figures stepped out of the boat. </p><p>“State your business,” Ser Harrold stated, “why have you come to Pyke?” </p><p>“We’re here to see Princess Levana Velaryon.” </p><p>Galatea turned to Levana who had a puzzled expression on her face. The two knights looked at each other and then back at the hooded figures. </p><p>“Take off your cloaks,” Ser Nandor ordered, “if you are here to see the Princess, we have the right to see who you are.”</p><p>The two figures turned to each other and seemed to be hesitant. Levana noticed this and stepped forward towards the knights.</p><p>“Princess, stay back,” Ser Harrold stated, “we do not know how they are.”</p><p>“I am Princess Levana,” The princess stated, “what business do you have with me?”</p><p>“I hardly recognized you,” one of the hooded figures chuckled, “it seems like only yesterday when you were nine.” </p><p>Ser Harrold stepped in front of the princess as one of the hooded figures attempted to approach her, “off with the cloak before I force it off.” </p><p>Levana placed a hand on Ser Harrold’s shoulder and shook her head. The princess watched as the figure nearest to the boat produced a box from it, “we would like to present a gift to the future Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.” </p><p>“How did you know where she was?” Ser Nandor asked.</p><p>“Airell Drahar sailed this way,” the male in front of Ser Harrold stated, “people in Essos stated that she was to meet with Princess Levana and her Small Council.” </p><p>“Who are you?” Levana asked as she walked closer towards the figure, attempting to get a closer look. The male looked up at her and smiled; the princess almost fell backward when Ser Nandor caught her. Soldiers began to surround the two men with their swords drawn as Levana gathered herself. </p><p>“Wait, stop!” Levana commanded, “move away from that man.” </p><p>“Your Grace, do you know him?” Ser Nandor asked as Levana once again approached him, reaching forward to push the hood off his head. </p><p>“Hello, beloved.” </p><p>Levana began to cry at the sight of the man; it felt almost cathartic as she embraced him tightly. The man wrapped his arms around her as well; kneeling down when he felt that Levana was about to fall. </p><p>The princess broke away from their embrace to take a good look at him, she touched his face with both her hands in an attempt to assure that she wasn’t dreaming. </p><p>“Father?” Levana asked, “is it really you?” </p><p>Ser Laenor Velaryon smiled at his daughter and wrapped his arms around her again, “I’m here, beloved.” </p><p>Levana sobbed in her father’s arms; unable to speak as Galatea approached them. Her heart swelled with joy at the sight of her former Lord reuniting with his daughter. </p><p>“How?” Levana asked, “where have you been? Why did you leave me?” </p><p>There were so many questions that Levana wanted to ask as Ser Laenor hung his head in shame, “had I only known that your mother would leave you to fend for yourself after I left, I wouldn’t have agreed to go.” </p><p>Levana couldn’t speak another word. Her father was alive and he was there right in front of her. </p><p>“I was at your wedding,” Laenor smiled, “I kept my promise.” </p><p>The princess just smiled as the other hooded figure removed his cloak. Ser Qarl knelt before the princess and opened the box in his hands to reveal a golden crown encrusted with rubies. It looked familiar to Levana as she looked at her father and then at Ser Qarl.</p><p>“A gift for our future Queen,” Ser Qarl spoke as Levana approached him and embraced him as well. For once, she felt like a child again in the presence of people that she had thought to have died many moons ago. </p><p>“We have Seasmoke,” Levana turned to her father, “Galatea rides him now.” </p><p>“Galatea?” Ser Laenor turned to the lady who bowed her head, “are you a…” </p><p>Galatea nodded, “and I am proud to be one under the command of Princess Levana.” </p><p>Ser Laenor looked at his daughter. If there was one thing that he could feel at the moment, it was pride - his daughter had grown to be such an amazing woman that he couldn’t help but cry again as he embraced her. </p><p>They were together again, at last.</p><p> </p><p align="center">━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</p><p><br/>Rhaenyra stood in front of his eldest son with a longing expression. </p><p>“It’s for the best, mother,” Jacaerys stated as Joffrey, clad in traveling clothes approached. Rhaenyra looked at his two sons and embraced them tightly. </p><p>They were all she had left of the life she once lived. </p><p>“Lady Jeyne Arryn will look after you, Joffrey,” Rhaenyra stated, “the most important thing is that you and Rhaena will stay together.” </p><p>Joffrey began to cry as he held onto Jacaerys’ garments, “I don’t want to go.” </p><p>“You have to, Joff,” Jacaerys stated, “we need to keep you and Rhaena safe.” </p><p>“I want Ana,” Joffrey mumbled, “Ana is the only one who can keep me safe.” </p><p>“Levana is no longer a part of this family, Joffrey,” Rhaenyra pointed out, “and the sooner that you arrive at The Vale, the better.” </p><p>Jacaerys hung his head as he pointed for his brother to leave the room. Joffrey nodded slightly before sulking his way out. Jacaerys looked at his mother and bowed before walking after his younger brother.</p><p>“Jacaerys,” Rhaenyra called, “I’m sorry.” </p><p>Jacaerys shook his head, “I’ll see them again,” he smiled slightly before walking out of the room. Meanwhile, Daemon walked inside just as the Velaryon prince was about to exit; the Rogue Prince nodded at the younger royal who left the room.</p><p>“Aegon and Viserys have boarded the ship to Pentos,” Daemon stated, “we should go see them off.” </p><p>Rhaenyra nodded before walking toward her husband, “are we doing the right thing, Daemon?” </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Sending our children away.” </p><p>“This would be the best for all of them,” Daemon stated, “they won’t be gone forever.” </p><p>“Two will,” Rhaenyra sighed. </p><p>“No, just one,” Daemon corrected, “you said so yourself that Levana is no longer your daughter.” </p><p>“I am partially to blame,” Rhaenyra sighed, “I cannot help but yearn for my firstborn.” </p><p>“You can mourn for her when she’s dead,” Daemon said blankly, “that way, she won’t be able to retaliate.” </p><p>“Why do you hate her so?” Rhaenyra asked, “she’s my child just like Jacaerys and the rest but you find my other children bearable.” </p><p>Daemon looked at his wife and chuckled slightly, “because your daughter doesn’t know where her loyalties lie.” </p><p>“She was loyal to me.” </p><p>“How sure are you when you weren’t present in her life for a decade?” Daemon asked, “just how sure are you that she’s defending you in the Red Keep?” </p><p>“Levana isn’t like that,” Rhaenyra defended, “I know that she meant what she said.” </p><p><strong>“Then continue to live in a lie, Rhaenyra,”</strong> the Rogue Prince stated, <strong>“watch where it takes you.” </strong></p>

<p>
<span>Levana sat inside her room; her dagger, sword, and crown placed neatly beside each other on a table by the window. She was due to have her coronation at dawn and while she already agreed to it, there was a part of her that believed that she was still unqualified for the task. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Being a Queen was definitely something else - something that she didn’t see herself doing so soon. She believed that she was not as prepared as she wanted to be; no one taught her what to do. Levana was following instinct and heart - as much of a bad combination that is. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the time alone to think.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father finally reunited with her grandmother - a reunion that was definitely for the books. Rhaenys gave Laenor a scolding after exchanging embraces and catching up with each other. The Queen Who Never Was decided to leave out what happened to Lucerys - she would allow Levana to break the news when she finally had time alone with her father after the coronation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Somehow, Levana missed the Red Keep during an event like this. She missed choosing clothes with her husband and matching with him; she missed watching Helaena and Queen Alicent fuss over small details of the event. But more than anything, she missed it when she would wait by the gates of the Red Keep to wait for her family to arrive.</span>
</p><p>
<b>But everything was different now. </b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana would have to be crowned alone but at least, she had her father and grandmother; as well as the people who believed in her by her side. She wasn’t so sure if she was going to win the war but she would die trying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace?” Galatea spoke from the other side of the door, “may I come in?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The princess took a deep breath, “yes you may, Galatea.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lady opened the door and walked inside with Lady Nesrin and Alys in tow. Galatea quickly shut the door behind her before standing by the two Strong ladies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace, Alys has approached us with a proposition,” Galatea stated, “she can help us find the assailants who murdered Prince Baelon and Princess Aemma.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana raised a brow, “just how do you propose to do this?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Many people call me a witch, My Queen,” Alys stated, “I can see visions in flames, clouds, and water.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if we know who they are,” Levana sighed, “we won’t be able to punish them for what they did to my children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alys knelt down in front of Levana and looked up at the princess, “let me avenge your children in your stead, Your Grace,” she requested, “I will use whatever abilities that I have to make sure that they get the death that they deserve.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want them brought here,” Levana stated, “I want to be the one to punish them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Witch Queen nodded before standing up, “it shall be done, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alys and I will be returning to Harrenhal,” Lady Nesrin said, “we will be keeping an eye on the activities in King’s Landing as you are crowned and when we return, we will have the people who murdered your children in tow.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The princess took a deep breath and nodded, “please take as much of your troops as you need to escort you back to Harrenhal safely.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nesrin and Alys bowed and as they were about to leave, the latter turned to the princess and smiled at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll be with him again soon, Your Grace,” Alys said, “he will come soon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two Strong ladies left the room and Galatea turned to the princess, “best not to trust in Alys Rivers too much, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why so?” Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Nesrin herself said that her sister was not someone to be trusted,” Galatea explained, “even House Strong doesn’t know where Alys’ loyalties lie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The princess sighed and looked at the crown, “keep an eye on her and if she tries something funny, you can burn her down with Seasmoke’s flames.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t waste dragon flame on someone like her,” Galatea chuckled, “such is an honor reserved for those who deserve it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “I can’t thank you enough, Galatea.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever for, Your Grace?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For keeping your promise to me,” Levana stated, “for being here with me today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Grace," Galatea smiled, "like King Viserys, I always believed that you were destined for greatness." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"How could you tell?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"From the day that you managed to escape from my line of sight as a toddler," Galatea laughed, "it's still a mystery how you managed to escape." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have my ways,” Levana laughed as Galatea held her hand in hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will be a fine Queen,” Galatea assured, “you have my trust, that of the Free Cities, and Dorne.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The Blacks will have the upper hand if you decide to remove yourself from the succession, Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince turned to his mother with a raised brow as he continued to dress himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to look for my wife,” Aemond stated, “Aegon’s fall was his own fault.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is your brother!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s always thought of me as inferior to him,” Aemond hissed, “he will find no brother in me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond, pleased,” Alicent pleaded, “think rationally about this matter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am thinking rationally,” the prince responded, “yours is a cause that I no longer want to fight for.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are your family.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva is my family too,” Aemond stated, “she is my wife and the mother of my children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you turned your back on us, Aemond?” Alicent asked, “just because of your wife?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond was infuriated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana Velaryon is our enemy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is yours,” Aemond said plainly, “but she isn’t mine and if you’re only saying this because she is no longer serving the purpose that you had when you betrothed us, then you are the traitor.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You dare to call your own mother a traitor?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana’s mother betrayed her when our children were killed,” Aemond reasoned, “why should I not think the same about you when you agreed to brand Eva as a traitor considering that she saw you as a mother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did it because it is my duty to the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond had enough of the argument. Taking his sword belt from the table, he began to walk out of the room; ignoring the cries and pleas of his mother. He knew that he had only a few moments before he would be seized by the guards so he needed to make haste and reach the Dragonpit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince turned his back to see his older brother, the king, in such a sorry state. He could barely stand on his own and needed the assistance of a maester to walk. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“If you leave now, I will have your head on a spike.”</b>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chuckled, “draw your sword and do it yourself if you can, Aegon,” he said as he continued to walk towards the stables.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You and Levana will die together!” Aegon shouted, “you will never win this war!” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I won’t,”</b>
<span> Aemond turned to face his brother one last time, </span>
<b>“but my Queen will.” </b>

<p>
<span>Dawn came upon the Iron Islands as the lords and ladies of House Greyjoy along with their sworn houses gathered at Pyke. Levana was dressed in her signature colors of gold and red as she waited inside her room - her coronation was going to begin in a few minutes and all she could think about was the impending war that would happen immediately after.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Beloved?” Laenor opened the door slightly, “are you decent?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled, “you may come in, father.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor laughed in response as he entered the room. Closing the door behind him as he looked upon his daughter. A sense of pride swelled in his chest as he saw her - as a father, he couldn’t be more proud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I would come and see you before the coronation,” Laenor said as he sat beside her, “to help you calm down in case you were nervous.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled, there was still a part of her that couldn’t believe that her father was right beside her. She had long thought of him dead and the fact that he was beside her was surreal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were you really at my wedding?” Levana asked, “what did you think of it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was better than mine, that’s for sure,” Laenor laughed, “more than anything, I’m just glad that you and Aemond grew to be so in love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is all that I could ever want,” Levana confessed, “he’s an amazing man, husband, and father,” her face fell as she placed a hand on her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor took a deep breath, “I heard you had a pair of twins.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baelon and Aemma,” Levana smiled, “they were amazing children and I loved them more than my own life.”</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>The male looked at his daughter’s eyes and saw nothing but pain and longing when she spoke about her children. He could only assume that something had happened to his grandchildren - something grim. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You need not tell me what happened,” Laenor took Levana’s hand in his, “but my heart is with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daemon took them from me,” Levana revealed, “before the onset of the war, Rhaenyra sent Lucerys to Storm’s End to treat with Lord Borros…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor listened on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Aemond and I secured the alliance for Aegon first,” the princess continued, “I was out of commission because of my pregnancy so I wasn’t able to see Lucerys when he came and Aemond took to the skies to go after him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a part of Laenor that immediately wanted to get mad - he partially knew where the story was going to go. Regardless of what people say, Lucerys is his son; just as Jacaerys and Joffrey are. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond and Lucerys lost control of their dragons and Arrax attacked Vhagar,” Levana took a deep breath, “Vhagar pursued my brother and he was killed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s the body?” Laenor asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I sent my brother to the pyre,” Levana stated, “then a few days after, Daemon sent assailants to the Red Keep and took both my children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The princess took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They were barely three,” the princess looked up to prevent her tears from falling. Laenor looked at his daughter and wrapped her arms tightly around her, pulling her into an embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Laenor said, “I’m sorry that you had to go through all of this and I wasn’t here to help you shoulder the burden.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry that I wasn’t here when you needed someone the most and I’m sorry that I let you suffer,” Laenor apologized, sobbing as he embraced his daughter tighter. There were so many things that he wanted to say but he couldn’t put it into words. Levana embraced her father just as tight and placed a kiss on his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father, I understand,” Levana said softly, “you did what you thought was right and whatever happened after was not on you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor broke the embrace and looked at Levana who smiled at him softly, “I never blamed you for what happened to me and I never will because you have been nothing but an amazing father to me and it was your love that brought me here today.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The male sighed slightly, “you’ve grown into such an amazing woman and I couldn’t be more proud to call you my daughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always will be,” Levana smiled, “I carry the Velaryon name proudly and I will even after the day that I sit on the Iron Throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor nodded as a knock came upon the door. Galatea opened the door ever so slightly and peeked her head inside, “it’s time, Your Graces.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at her and nodded her head before standing up from the bed. Laenor stood up after her and took the boxed crown from the table. Galatea, on the other hand, took the Conqueror’s Dagger and handed it to the princess who placed it securely on her waist. Laenor handed the box over to Galatea before taking the Conqueror’s Sword in his hand and nodding at his daughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s be off,” the princess smiled before walking out of the door. Laenor and Galatea followed closely behind her as she made her way towards the gates. She would be having her coronation in front of the stronghold - where everyone could see her. Levana was no longer hiding at this point and if anyone were to see her, it would further establish her claim to the Iron Throne and would immediately make her a part of the war.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She arrived at the front of the stronghold, Grand Maester Priamos standing beside the High Septon on a high stage. Galatea walked up to the stage first, standing beside the High Septon with the box in her hands. Laenor, on the other hand, stood beside Galatea as Levana walked to the center of the stage, facing the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor remained perched on top of the stronghold while Cannibal and Silverwing stood strong beside it. Grey Ghost and Seasmoke, on the other hand, kept their distance from the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The High Septon began to speak:</span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>Today is a great day for the Iron Islands. </b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>A new day for our realms, a new day for our cause, and a new queen to lead us. </b>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd began to cheer as Levana looked at them. Among those were King Besian, the Lords and Ladies of House Greyjoy as well as Prince Sorin and his entourage from Dorne. She never expected for her cause to involve so many people but, more than anything, she was glad to have them by her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned toward the High Septon and knelt down in front of him as he began to anoint her with oil: </span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>May the Father defend her in her need. May the Crone lift her shining lamp and light her way to wisdom.</b>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea and Rhaenys stepped forward, the former held up the box in her hands to present to the crowd as Princess Rhaenys spoke, “the crown of the Queen that will usher in a new era for the realms.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea presented the crown to Rhaenys who took it in her hands. The princess stepped in front of Levana and held the crown over her head, “</span>
<b>Let the Seven bear witness that Levana Velaryon of House Targaryen is the true Queen of the Realms and the Seven Kingdoms.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys placed the crown on Levana’s head; the latter slowly stood up as Rhaenys stepped back. Levana then turned to the crowd as Laenor presented the Conqueror’s sword to her. The High Septon raising his arms:</span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>All hail Her Grace, Levana Velaryon, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>Levana the Queen! </b>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd began to cheer as Prince Sorin yelled, </span>
<b>“all hail the Mother of Dragons!” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled slightly as she raised the sword in her hands. The dragons immediately roared as she turned to them. The newly crowned Queen held the sword by her side as she raised her hand to settle the crowd. She walked off the stage and took her place at the bottom of it, looking at the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Today, I give you all freedom,” Levana proclaimed, “anyone who wishes to leave may do so and no harm will come to them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd listened on. </span>
</p><p>
<b>"Will all of you fight for me as free men and women?" </b>
</p><p>
<span>The first to step forward was Prince Sorin who bent the knee, “I, Prince Sorin Nymeros of House Martell swears toward Queen Levana and I shall remain faithful to her,” he smiled as he looked up the Queen, “I pledge fealty to her and shall defend her against all enemies in good faith and without deceit - this I swear by the old gods and the new." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled at him, “rise, Prince Sorin, I do not wish for you to bend the knee to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are my Queen,” Prince Sorin smiled, “let me have the honor of bending the knee to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>King Besian approached them, bending the knee as well, “I, King Besian of House Greyjoy swears toward Queen Levana and I shall remain faithful to her,” he said, “I pledge fealty to her and shall defend her against all enemies in good faith and without deceit - this I swear by the old gods and the new."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon, the Lords and Ladies began to take the knee as well. Levana turned to the stage to see that Galatea and her father had done the same. Princess Rhaenys waited for her granddaughter to look at her before bending the knee as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana, for the longest time, believed that she was nothing without her mother’s claim to the throne. But today, she felt as though she had everything that she needed to protect the realm. She would serve the realm by putting an end to the war of succession.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even if it meant giving up her life for it.</span>

<span>“Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra turned to Ser Erryk who bowed to her respectfully, “we have news of Harrenhal, Dorne, and the Triarchy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra looked at Lord Corlys who now served as her Hand of the Queen before nodding at the knight, “what news do we have, Ser Erryk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All of Dorne’s Houses, including House Martell have started to raise banners,” Ser Erryk began, “it’s the same banners as Harrenhal and the Triarchy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Greens?” Lord Corlys asked, the knight shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The banners are red with a golden three-headed dragon in the middle,” Ser Erryk stated, “our sources have informed us that the same is the case for the Iron Islands.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana…” Rhaenyra muttered, “that must be her banner.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My granddaughter?” Corlys looked at Rhaenyra in shock, “why did no one tell me that my granddaughter has chosen to bring up her own banners?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rest easy, Lord Corlys,” Rhaenyra took a deep breath, “this has not yet been confirmed though it is a speculation as Levana was last seen headed west toward the Iron Islands.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what reason does Levana have to go against you?” Corlys asked, “why has no one told me the truth of it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lord Corlys, the truth will be said in time,” Rhaenyra swore, “right now, we need to find out if those banners really belong to Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Red and gold,” Jacaerys mumbled, “those are the colors that Ana always wears, doesn’t she?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jacaerys, not now,” Rhaenyra responded, “the Golds are what we will call them for now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Golds have occupied the Narrow Sea and with the strength of the Iron Fleet and the Triarchy, they’ve managed to remove the blockades that the Velaryon Fleet has put up,” Ser Erryk informed, “if it is true that Princess Levana has both fleets, she can rival the might Velaryon Fleet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is Daemon?” Corlys asked, “maybe he should see if it is my granddaughter who rules the Iron Islands.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daemon is on his way to Harrenhal to secure the stronghold,” Rhaenyra stated, “if our sources are correct, they do not have dragons there and it will fall easily if Caraxes is present.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Aemond?” Jacaerys asked, “what if Aemond is there?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then he will have to go over Daemon’s dead body before he can take Harrenhal,” Rhaenyra responded, “he might be the rider of the largest dragon in the world but he is not as experienced as Daemon when it comes to battle.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If Aemond perishes…” Jacaerys trailed off, “what about Ana?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lord Corlys approached his grandson, placing a hand on his shoulder, “I’m worried about your sister as well but if she no longer has a place in this court, it would be best to not mention her,” he whispered as Jacaerys looked up at him and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The young prince knew more than anything that further mention of his older sister would only bring about bad news - especially since her mother and sister are not on the best terms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jacaerys, since you’re so eager,” Rhaenyra began, “take Vermax to the Iron Islands and treat with whoever sits there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Your Grace--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will do so today,” the Black Queen ordered, “I want to know who we are going against and if it is Levana, she will need to know the consequences of going against us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lord Corlys couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Rhaenyra had every intention to fight her own flesh and blood - his granddaughter. But he knew better than to react, instead, he remained stoic, eyeing at Jacaerys who bowed and made his way out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace!” Ser Steffon ran into the room in a panic. Jacaerys stopped in his tracks as the knight approached his mother, “the Triarchy has intercepted the Gay Abandon in the Stepstones.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra stood up from her seat, “Jace,” she turned to his son, “you have to take Vermax and head to the Stepstones.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys nodded before quickly making his way to the Dragonmont to retrieve his dragon, Vermax. There were a million things in his mind at present but one thing was clear - he needed to save his sister and his brothers from this war.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Levana walked toward Pyke’s Great Hall with her Small Council in tow. In front of them were her Queensguard composed of Ser Nandor, Ser Qarl, and their Lord Commander, Ser Harrold. Dressed in her colors of red and gold, the Queen stood confidently in the presence of her council.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Make way for the Queen!” Ser Qarl raised his voice as the lords and ladies stepped aside to give way for the entourage. The Queen looked out of the window to see her dragons flying from a distance; Vermithor and Cannibal were easy enough to spot as they were the largest among them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they approached the Great Hall, Levana stopped slightly, seeing a shadow of a younger version of her by the crowd - watching the dragons. She smiled to herself, she’s seen this scene before in a vision; she was living in it now. </span>
</p><p>
<b>"Presenting the members of the Queen's small council starting with Grand Maester Priamos," </b>
<span>Ser Nandor called as the maester stepped toward the Painted Table, "our </span>
<b>Master of Coin, Prince Sorin Martell and Master of Laws, Lady Nesrin Strong</b>
<span>," the knight continued as the two made their way beside Maester Priamos. </span>
</p><p>
<b>"Presenting Alys Rivers, our Master of Whisperers,"</b>
<span> Ser Qarl announced, "</span>
<b>along with the Master of Ships and the Commander of the Golden Fleet, King Besian Greyjoy." </b>
</p><p>
<b>"Our Lord Confessor, Airell Drahar, the Scorpion Queen,"</b>
<span> Ser Nandor added, "</span>
<b>along with Lady Galatea Greyjoy and Ser Laenor Velaryon, the Queen's advisers." </b>
</p><p>
<span>Once the other members of the Queen's council assembled at the Painted Table, Princess Rhaenys began to walk towards the end, taking her place at the Queen's right as Ser Qarl nodded at her.</span>
</p><p>
<b>"Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, the Hand of the Queen," </b>
<span>Ser Qarl stated as Levana walked into the Great Hall, an entourage of knights following behind her as Ser Westerling cleared his throat, </span>
<b>"Queen Levana Velaryon, First Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, and the Protector of the Realm." </b>
</p><p>
<span>The knights stopped by the door as Levana advanced towards the Painted Table where she stood beside her grandmother and father. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is our standing?” Levana asked as Maester Priamos took out a list, “as of today, Your Grace, we have amassed about sixty thousand soldiers from Houses Martell, Greyjoy, and the Triarchy - a mixture of knights, crossbowmen, men-at-arms,” he narrated, “this is in addition to the hundred and fifty ships under the yoke of Airell Drahar and House Greyjoy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can dispatch more,” Airell stated, “presently, we also have a hundred boats in the Stepstones which gives your naval force around three hundred ships, Your Grace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys turned to Levana, “the hundred ships in the Stepstones alone is enough to rival the Velaryon fleet,” she whispered as the Queen nodded with a small sigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about Harrenhal?” Levana asked, “how are our forces there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At present, your Grace, we have a little over a hundred and fifty soldiers guarding the stronghold,” Nesrin answered, “but that hundred and fifty will not be enough to withstand dragons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Galatea,” Levana called, “would you be willing to take Seasmoke and guard Harrenhal until the threat from the Blacks and Greens have subsided?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will leave at once, Your Grace,” Galatea nodded, “though, Lady Nesrin did receive correspondence earlier from her House that Prince Daemon poses a large threat to the stronghold.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seasmoke won’t stand a chance against Caraxes alone,” Levana thought for a while, “I can send Cannibal with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that wise, Your Grace?” Prince Sorin asked as Levana nodded, “he’s a bonded dragon and he doesn’t see Seasmoke as a threat, it is unlikely that he will try to eat him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should also start talking about how we are to advance against King’s Landing,” Princess Rhaenys brought up, “three dragons still exist there and they still have Vhagar.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana had hoped that her husband wouldn’t be brought up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can send at least four thousand soldiers to King’s Landing,” Levana stated, “I doubt that Aegon or whoever is in-charge now would have amassed that much in terms of their military strength.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who will lead them, Your Grace?” Airell asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ser Qarl,” Levana turned towards the knight, “I entrust you with this task.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor looked at his daughter and almost stopped her but Ser Qarl stepped forward, “it would be my honor, Queen Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now then, we can also--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A maester burst into the room, panting heavily as he approached Maester Priamos with a scroll. The former began to whisper into the Grand Maester’s ear as the latter unraveled the scroll and read its contents. Levana watched her Grand Maester as he turned to her, “there is an ongoing battle at the Gullet and our fleet has encountered the Blacks.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?” Laenor asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A ship that most likely carries the Queen’s siblings and the Velaryon Fleet,” Grand Maester Priamos stated as Levana’s eyes widened. Almost immediately, the Queen rushed past her council and began to undo the strings that held her skirt in place to reveal her riding gear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Galatea, King Besian, please fly with me,” the Queen requested as she made her way out of the Great Hall and headed toward one of the towers where she called for Vermithor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Bronze Fury immediately arrived at his rider’s aid with Cannibal and Silverwing in tow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana!” Laenor shouted from the tower, “it isn’t safe for you to be out in the battlefield!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will not be the monarch who will sit idly and watch as my forces fight in my stead,” Levana responded, “I have the means to protect the realm and I will!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will be made into their target!” Laenor argued. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They will have to catch me first,” Levana chuckled as she flew off. Cannibal and Silverwing followed after Vermithor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll protect her, My Lord!” Galatea shouted as she appeared on dragonback with her older brother on Grey Ghost. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor watched as the dragons disappeared into the sky. He would have to stand back for now and see what will come of the battle. If it is Levana’s will to protect the realm personally, he would have to respect his daughter’s wishes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She is the Queen afterall. </span>

<p>
<span>“It’s the Queen!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana heard one of the men on their ships shout as Vermithor flew above them. The Queen could see the damage from the sky and turned to King Besian who looked concerned about the numbers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Most of the downed ships are of the Blacks, Your Grace,” King Besian stated, “there is one ship with a dragon on it,” he pointed at one of the ships surrounded by others from the Velaryon Fleet. Galatea turned to Levana, “does the dragon look familiar, My Queen?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head, “it must belong to either Aegon or Viserys,” she muttered as Vermithor suddenly flew to a different direction. The Queen noticed that an arrow had been aired towards them; muttering a curse, Levana commanded her dragon to dive down toward the ships - unleashing fire upon the fleet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Retrieve the princes,” Levana ordered, “I want my brothers alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea and Besian nodded at each other before fending off the ships from the Velaryon Fleet. Levana took it upon herself to deliver her orders to the ships - as much as possible, she didn’t want any of her siblings to perish because of the war.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fly low, Vermithor,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana commanded, </span>
<em>
<span>“get me as close to that ship as possible.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>At her command, the Bronze Fury swooped down and unleashed fire upon the ships of the Velaryon Fleet. Once she was close enough to jump on the ship, Levana took a deep breath and leaped off of her dragon, stumbling slightly as she landed on the deck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked around to see that most of the soldiers on board had already abandoned ship - this meant that only her brothers were left on board.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Viserys!” Levana shouted, “Aegon!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The dragon on deck growled at her but she approached it with no fear, she held her hand out and touched its snout. The small dragon immediately reeled back as Levana heard stumbling from one of the rooms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon? Viserys?” Levana called out as she approached the door, pushing it slightly to reveal her younger half-siblings huddled in a corner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother?” Aegon squinted his eyes, as if he were trying to decipher who she was; Viserys, on the other hand, separated from his brother to run towards Levana. He hugged her leg and the Queen noticed that he had a dragon egg in his arms. Aegon, on the other hand, looked at her warily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You needn’t be afraid,” Levana said, “I will make sure that you’re safe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon took a good look at her before slowly standing up from the floor and walking towards her, just in time for the ship to start sinking. The Queen cursed under her breath as she was forced to pick-up Viserys and take Aegon’s wrist, pulling him out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Silverwing! Vermithor!” Levana called as the Bronze Fury approached her, she mounted Viserys on her dragon first before picking up Aegon and doing the same. She turned toward Silverwing and then at the dragon who was chained to the deck, </span>
<em>
<span>“break its chains.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Silverwing growled as the Queen mounted Vermithor who then began to fly. She turned to see that Silverwing was right behind them with the whelp in tow; a sign of relief escaped Levana’s lips as she flew towards her fleet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Galatea, King Besian,” Levana shouted, “fall back!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen turned her head to see her younger brother, Jacaerys, flying towards them. She muttered a curse under breath as Vermithor continued to fly; faster this time. Vermax, however, was relentless in his pursuit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana!” Jacaerys called, “I want to talk!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana sighed deeply as she commanded for her dragon to land in one of the islands. As soon as she did, Cannibal followed. She unmounted quickly from Vermithor and commanded it to return to the Iron Islands with her younger brothers. The Bronze Fury bellowed in distaste but followed her orders nonetheless - just in the nick of time for Jacaerys to land his own dragon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it true?” Jacaerys asked, “did you really raise your own banners?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “the Golds.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Jacaerys asked, “why are you doing this?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rhaenyra never told you, did she?” Levana asked, “how typical it is for her to put the burden on my shoulders.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana, please,” Jacaerys walked towards her but he couldn’t get too close as Cannibal immediately roared at his approach and the prince could do nothing except take a step back. Levana placed a hand on her dragon’s neck as she approached Jacaerys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daemon murdered my children,” Levana stated bluntly, “Baelon and Aemma were taken from me as ‘payment’ for Lucerys.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother wouldn’t allow that to happen…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It already has,” Levana looked at the ground, “and I am only carrying out the wishes of King Viserys to end the war of his succession.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you not desire the Iron Throne for yourself, Ana?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Iron Throne is my birthright,” Levana stated, “as it is our mother’s but I will  not allow this war to carry on at the expense of people’s lives, Jace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to fight you, Ana,” Jacaerys said, “and I don’t want you to fight mother either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at her younger brother with a sad smile, “I’ve lost Queen Rhaenyra as a mother the moment that she married Daemon,” she said, “I have the truth of it now from our father.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father?” Jacaerys raised a brow, “our father is long gone, Ana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lord Laenor Velaryon is alive and well, Jacaerys,” Levana stated, “he deeply misses and cares for you and Joffrey.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lies.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our mother and Daemon arranged for our father to escape to the Free Cities in the guise of a death,” Levana explained, “so they could get married and Queen Rhaenyra would have a </span>
<em>
<span>proper </span>
</em>
<span>King Consort by her side.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys was speechless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our father loves you, Jace,” Levana said, “he loves all of us regardless of what has happened.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I refuse to believe that our father is alive,” Jacaerys shook his head, “for what reason do I have to believe you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana walked towards her younger brother and wrapped her arms tightly around him, “I have never lied to you, Jacaerys,” she whispered, “I kept nothing from you,” she added before placing a kiss on his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What you do with what I have told you is up to you, brother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana walked to Cannibal, mounting him before taking one more look at her younger brother and smiling, “the Iron Islands remains open for you and our other siblings, Rhaena and Baela included.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can just fly there?” Jacaerys asked, “we won’t be shot down like grandmother?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Princess Rhaenys is alive,” Levana stated, “she presently serves as my Hand.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grandsire will go against mother if she finds out that grandmother is alive,” Jacaerys stated, “is that what you want?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said, Jacaerys,” the Queen sighed, “what you do with the knowledge that you have is up to you and even if you choose to pick up your side and fight against me, I will respect that because you have made that decision for yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys watched as Cannibal spread its wings to prepare for flight, “I never betrayed our mother, Jacaerys, but she betrayed me,” Levana stated before Cannibal took to the skies and disappeared into the clouds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The young prince was left to his own thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Who was he to believe now?</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>“Levana, this is a bad idea,” Laenor stated as he looked at the two children huddled together on his daughter’s bed, “if Rhaenyra finds out that they are alive, she will not hesitate to attack us head on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then we will fight them head on if they decide to bring the battle to us,” Levana responded, “we are more equipped than they are in terms of soldiers and dragons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would you bring them here, beloved?” Rhaenys asked, “for what reason do you have to keep them here?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They are children, grandmother,” Levana responded, “they don’t deserve this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But that doesn’t mean keep them here,” Laenor reasoned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you rather I let them die, father?” Levana asked, “they were left for dead on that ship!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys and Laenor looked at each other, the latter sighing audibly as Aegon waddled towards Levana, his arms raised, asking to be lifted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They are barely the same age as my children,” Levana stated as she picked up Aegon and placed him on her lap. The young prince leaned his head against her shoulder as the Queen looked at her father and grandmother, </span>
<em>
<span>“they will be kept safe here.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“They will end up looking for your mother,” </span>
</em>
<span>Laenor stated, </span>
<em>
<span>“what do you propose we do about it then?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“They will know me as their mother,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana responded, </span>
<em>
<span>“they’re young, they can be taught.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Ana, this is crazy,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenys sighed, </span>
<em>
<span>“your brother must be aware that they are here if you had the time to have a conversation with him.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen shook her head, </span>
<em>
<span>“I sent both of them away on Vermithor before he arrived.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“What will your husband say?” </span>
</em>
<span>Laenor asked, </span>
<em>
<span>“surely he wouldn’t approve of this.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I can take care of my husband,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana assured, </span>
<em>
<span>“I don’t want to worry about him yet when he isn’t in our presence.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys sighed and stood up before heading to the door, </span>
<em>
<span>“well, it’s too late to bring them back,” </span>
</em>
<span>she sighed, “I can only hope that you know what you’re doing, beloved.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor stood up as well before leaning towards Levana and placing a kiss on the top of her head. The two Velaryons headed towards the door only to be greeted by Alys and Nesrin who stood waiting by it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“To what do we owe the pleasure?” Laenor asked as the two ladies from House Strong bowed their heads in unison.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We wish to speak with the Queen,” Nesrin requested, “alone, if that would be alright, Lord Advisor and Lady Hand.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor looked over at Levana who nodded in response. Laenor looked at his mother nodding  before exiting the room and allowing the two ladies to enter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall we take the children, Your Grace?” Rhaenys asked as Levana nodded, standing up gently to set Aegon on the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon, Viserys,” Levana spoke softly, “your grandparents will look after you while I tend to business.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Viserys and Aegon looked at each other before walking towards Laenor in silence. The latter looked back at Levana who smiled at him before her father shut the door behind him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose we have news of Harrenhal?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nesrin shook her head, “Harrenhal is being well guarded by Lady Galatea and the cavalry that you’ve sent, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s good to know,” Levana smiled as she took a seat again, placing a hand on her stomach, “what I can assist you with, Alys, Lady Nesrin?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can help with the children, Your Grace,” Alys stepped forward, “I would like to put what I have learned to use.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Levana raised a brow, “learned?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alys has been studying to make her abilities more useful, Your Grace,” Nesrin spoke up, “to further her contribution to the cause.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Witchcraft, you mean?” Levana asked, “what do you mean help me with the children?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alys and Nesrin looked at each other for a while in silence, eliciting a small gasp from Levana, “I do not intend to end their lives.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that, Your Grace!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can try to help them forget,” Alys said, “help them to forget what needs to be forgotten.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana thought for a while. It would be a lie if she would say that she wasn’t considering it but was this the right thing to do? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will consider it,” Levana stated, “but beyond that, have you news for the people that killed my children?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nesrin nodded, “they've been delivered to us when you were at the Gullet, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many?” Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Three,” Alys responded, “the two assailants and the one who works under the Blacks.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are they now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Lord Confessor is in the dungeons with them,” Nesrin informed, “one of them is a female, Your Grace and they speak of a traitor in our midst.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was enough to make the Queen wary of the situation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana stood up and walked towards the door, “I will see them,” she sighed, “I will consider your offer, Alys, thank you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two ladies bowed before Levana walked out of the room and headed towards the dungeons deep below Pyke. As she made her way down, she began to think of possible candidates as to who might be betraying her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had immense trust in Galatea and her brother - surely her own father and grandmother wouldn’t do that. She also trusted Ser Nandor and Ser Harrold with her life. The same could be said about her dragonkeepers. The possible traitors that she could think of were the ones that she welcomed into her council - those that she did not grow with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Airell,” Levana called as she entered one of the cells. Airell Drahar stood with a menacing presence as she wielded her </span>
<em>
<span>signature weapon</span>
</em>
<span>, a whip made of steel that was fashioned to be light enough to carry but still wield dangerous damage. Airell would douse her whip in a minacious amount of scorpion venom which would heavily leave her opponents in a critical state.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s how she earned the moniker, Scorpion Queen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My Queen,” Airell bowed her head slightly as Levana waved her hand before turning to the three </span>
<em>
<span>murderers </span>
</em>
<span>who were chained to the wall. Immediately, anger swelled in her heart at the sight of the two men who mercilessly slaughtered her children.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s them,” Levana confirmed, “those are the bastards that killed my children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>From where she was standing, Levana could see that Airell had already dealt heavy strikes against them - serving them right for what they did. The Queen’s attention would be captured by the female who was chained to the wall right beside them, her mouth gagged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had to gag her,” Airell stated, “she kept talking about a traitor from House Strong in our midst.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is oddly specific,” Levana said as she approached her, pulling the gag away from her mouth, “it’s been years and yet you still look the same, White Worm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How you’ve grown, princess,” Mysaria responded as she tried to fight against the chains, “I would be wary of the witch that you have in your ranks, she is just like me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt,” Levana responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daemon Targaryen has heavy influence, Your Grace,” Mysaria chuckled, “you would be wise to deal with the witch.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough!” Airell shouted as she raised her whip but Levana raised her hand to stop her. The Lord Confessor took a step back and lowered her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you know about Alys Rivers?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is helping Daemon Targaryen,” Mysaria responded, “not even her sister is aware of it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to Airell and nodded before making her way out of the chambers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever you do is up to you, Levana Velaryon,” Mysaria said as the Queen made her way out of the dungeons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It seems like whatever she told Jacaerys was just returned to her in a more difficult manner. </span>

<span>“Once Daemon secures Harrenhal, we will move to secure King’s Landing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How sure are we of the number in Harrenhal, Your Grace?” Lord Bartimos asked as Rhaenyra turned to him with an assuring smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have eyes on the inside,” Rhaenyra stated, “we are to trust Daemon’s sources within Levana’s camp for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How can we be so sure that the information is true?” Corlys raised a brow, “surely he would need to have someone within the Queen’s council to even have access to this information.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He does,” Rhaenyra affirmed, “we just have to trust him right now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys leaned against the wall with his arms folded across his chest. Baela stood next to him as the Queen began to instruct the council of their plans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have been silent since you arrived from the Gullet, Jacaerys,” Baela sighed, “I know that it is hard to accept what happened to Aegon and Viserys but I am with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that,” Jacaerys responded, “it’s Ana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Baela looked at him in shock, “you encountered Ana?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is she?” Baela asked, “is she well?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Velaryon prince turned to his betrothed with a smile. He knew how much Baela and Rhaena cared for his sister. Jacaerys nodded a response, “she is well but heavily pregnant.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She should be close to term by now,” Baela sighed deeply, “I worry for Ana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She won’t like that,” Jacaerys chuckled slightly, “she dislikes it when we worry for her, remember?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana is our sister, Jacaerys,” Baela said, “no matter what anyone says.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She told me that our father and grandmother are alive,” the prince whispered, “and I trust my sister to tell the truth no matter what.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does your mother know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys shook his head, “quite frankly, you’re the first to know because you are my betrothed and I trust you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you intend to do with what you know?” Baela asked, “will you join your sister’s cause?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys thought for a while.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love my sister and I respect the cause that she has,” Jacaerys looked toward his mother and took a deep breath, “but I am all that my mother has left to her support.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Baela was slightly disappointed at his response but she also acknowledged the difficult position that he was in. She held Jacaerys’ hand in hers and squeezed it tightly; the prince turned to her with an earnest smile</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever you decide, I will be with you,” Baela said, “and I will fly wherever you will.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys nodded as he turned his attention back to the meeting, listening to the details and devising a plan of his own. There were many factors that he needed to consider if he were to join his older sister - for one, he needed to retrieve Joffrey and Rhaena from the Vale as well - that alone was a difficult task. But then there was the escape from Dragonstone that he would have to administer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wouldn’t be so hard if he were alone but he wanted to take Baela with him. Such needed to be planned accordingly and he needed time. </span>

<span>“Daeron and Tessarion were shot down,” Alicent leaned back against her chair, “he was just flying over Dorne in an attempt to reach Storm’s End when they shot him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alicent,” Otto sighed, “do not lose hope.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Helaena is the only one that I have left,” Alicent responded, “Aegon’s condition is deteriorating by the hour, Daeron is dead, and Aemond has gone rogue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve locked down the capital,” Otto said, “we will be safe for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent looked at her father in disbelief before thinking for a while, “we should surrender to the Golds.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Criston looked at Otto and then at the Dowager Queen, “you can’t be serious, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“At the very least,” Alicent sighed, “Levana won’t be too harsh on us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you still believe in that?” Otto asked, “we’ve lost our hold on Levana Velaryon the moment that she left the Red Keep.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Dowager Queen took a deep breath, “she sees me as a mother figure, she will be kind to us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were not kind to her,” Otto stated, “we took away her husband and freedom from her, do you still believe that she has an ounce of kindness to spare?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Would you rather we fall to the mercy of Rhaenyra? Is that it?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Hightower male looked out the window, watching as the troops patrolled the castle. They didn't have many left options to consider and they were spoiled for choice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We will retreat to Oldtown," Otto said, "if we are discreet then we won't be seen fleeing the capital." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We can't be discreet when we have Aegon the children to worry about."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Then what do you propose we do?!" Otto slammed his fist against the table causing Alicent to jump slightly. There was a pause between them as she looked at her father, "if we surrender to the Golds, King's Landing will be protected."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Levana will send us to rot in jail," Ser Criston said plainly, "even if we do surrender to the Golds, there is no guarantee that they will win against the Blacks." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In a span of a few months, Levana has amassed an army larger than that of the Blacks,” Alicent stated, “I believe that she is capable of defeating them if she willed it.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“Levana is capable of anything.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>The three turned their attention to the door where Aegon was, sitting on a chair, being carried by soldiers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would rather surrender to her than to my sister,” Aegon stated, “she was always the best of her family.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon,” Alicent sighed, “it isn’t that easy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Write to Eva,” Aegon coughed, “you said so yourself, she sees you as a mother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t remove the very fact that we have done her wrong,” Alicent responded, “she no longer trusts us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure she still has some semblance of love for us in her heart,” Aegon laughed, “she’s too forgiving for her own good.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Otto slammed his fists against the table, “enough!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent, Aegon, and Criston turned to the former hand in shock as he began to make his way towards the king.</span>
</p><p>
<b>“We will not surrender,”</b>
<span> Otto stated, </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Levana sat inside the Small Council room with her grandmother and father by her side. Aegon and Viserys were sound asleep on makeshift beds inside the council room as the three Velaryons waited.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Laenor sighed, “it is not too late to refuse.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen shook her head as the door opened to reveal Galatea with Nesrin and Alys in tow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alys Rivers,” Levana took a deep breath as she stood up from her seat and walked towards the beds where her brothers were; she paused for a while before turning to the ladies from House Strong and nodded, “just please make sure that they wouldn’t get hurt.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can tell that your intentions towards the children are pure, Your Grace,” Alys smiled as she produced two vials from her dress and offered it to the Queen, “you can mix these liquids in with their milk or their soup.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will it be painless?” Levana asked as she took the vials in her hands, examining the reddish liquid, “I don’t want them to have to be in pain.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alys nodded, “you can rest assured that they won’t feel a thing, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen nodded and turned her back to pour the liquid into two small cups of milk before kneeling beside the two boys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon,” Levana called softly, “Viserys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two boys slowly opened their eyes as Levana smiled, she offered the cups to them gently, “you must be parched, my loves.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The twin boys sat up as they accepted the cups, the two drank its contents and after ensuring that they were well, Levana turned to her grandmother who nodded a response before standing up from her seat and escorting the boys out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Alys, you’ve served your purpose,” Levana stated as Ser Nandor and Ser Harrold walked into the room with a cavalry in tow. Alys looked at Nesrin who stepped aside, walking towards Queen Levana as the soldiers took the </span>
<em>
<span>witch </span>
</em>
<span>by the arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is this?!” Alys questioned as she tried to break free from the guards, “unhand me at once, I am the Queen’s Master of Whisperers!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not anymore,” Levana stated as Nesrin handed a bundle of letters to the Queen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve turned against me by revealing our plans to Daemon Targaryen,” Levana glared as she threw the bundle towards Alys, “do you deny?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nesrin,” Alys looked at her sister, “what the fuck is this?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I found your letters when Airell told me what the White Worm said,” Nesrin responded, “you’ve betrayed the Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you still deny it, Alys Rivers?” Laenor asked as he picked up one of the letters, “you’ve been caught.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alys began to laugh maniacally. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your husband is going to die,” Alys chuckled, “Daemon is going to kill him and it’s going to be your fault.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Over my dead body,” Levana hissed, “take the witch to Airell, she knows what to do from here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor walked to his daughter, placing a hand on her shoulder, “calm down, beloved, there is no cause for panic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not for now, at least.</span>

<p>
<span>"Airell has dealt judgment, Your Grace." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nesrin bowed her head as Levana sighed a response. The Small Council Chamber was silent as its members began to pile into the room. Airell came in last, shutting the door behind her with an accomplished smile on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look exceedingly happy,” Nesrin commented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finally got to deal with your bastard sister,” Airell responded, “I never liked her and I never kept that from you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you do it?” Levana asked, “exchange the vials?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nesrin and Airell looked at each other as the former produced two identical vials from her sleeve and placed it in front of the Queen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alys made a mistake about placing it along with the letters,” Nesrin stated, “they were very easy to find and copy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was the one who did the mixture,” Airell boasted, “it was very easy to copy the color but if Alys had checked the consistency before giving it to the Queen, it would have messed up the entire plan.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Levana asked, “what did I end up giving to my brothers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Nahsa,” Airell responded, “Nahsa with blueberries.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at her with a slightly confused expression, “and Nahsa is?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nahsa, Your Grace, is fermented milk with honey,” Airell smiled slightly, “it’s a drink that we have in Norvos.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana sighed deeply in relief, “thank you, Airell, Nesrin,” she nodded at them as the two ladies bowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for placing your trust in us, Your Grace,” Airell responded as she took a seat across Galatea. Nesrin, on the other hand, sat beside King Besian on the left of the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After making sure that everyone was in the room, Laenor produced a scroll from his jacket and handed it to Levana. The Queen turned to her grandmother who nodded a response as the former began to read its contents. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alicent Hightower is asking for sanctuary,” Laenor revealed, “they were barred by Criston Cole and Otto Hightower from leaving the capital.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Galatea asked as she looked at the Queen, “they were the ones who closed off the capital in the first place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alicent is seeking refuge for herself, Aegon, Helaena, and their children,” Levana stated as she leaned against her chair, “they apparently wanted to flee to Oldtown when Aegon and Alicent told them that they should surrender to us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I assume that Otto Hightower wasn’t too keen on that?” Prince Sorin asked, “typical.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was right about the fact that I see her as a mother,” Levana sighed, “but if the capital is closed off, we’re going to have a hard time entering it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Adding to that, we will need to cross the Riverlands,” Rhaenys stated, “House Strong is our only ally among those Houses.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s also Daemon Targaryen to worry about,” Laenor brought up, “he is stalking Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then we need to secure Harrenhal furth--” Levana stood up, a sharp pain going through her which caused her to sit back down abruptly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace?” Galatea walked to the Queen and knelt by her side, “are you alright?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen took deep breaths as the pain only grew more intense. She placed a hand on her stomach as she attempted to stand up again, “call Maester Priamos,” she requested as she began to walk towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Rhaenys walked towards her, helping her stand, </span>
<em>
<span>“what’s wrong?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“It’s the babe,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana responded, </span>
<em>
<span>“the babe is coming,” </span>
</em>
<span>she added, wincing in pain as the maesters rushed inside the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor noticed the trail of blood that his daughter had left as she was escorted away, he turned towards the other members of the council, </span>
<b>“the baby is coming.”</b>

<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Aemond looked at Harrenhal from a distance. It’s been a few days - maybe weeks - since he took refuge in the Isle of Faces, watching one of his wife’s strongholds. He heard word that Daemon Targaryen was making a move on Harrenhal and he wanted to be the one to protect it in the name of his wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince had come to terms with the Green Men that he would not bring harm to the Isle should his encounter with Daemon turn into a fight. He also promised that the Isle would be protected after the war - something that he still needed to discuss with his wife but that was a matter for another day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His patience was starting to grow thin as he continued to wait. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond intended to proceed to the Iron Islands at first but decided against it in favor of waiting for Daemon to arrive. He needed to prove to his wife he was still worthy of standing by her side - no matter what it takes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But more than anything, he yearned to see Levana again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Being apart from her for far too long made Aemond realize just how much he had messed up their relationship. He acknowledged that he was wrong in many ways - especially when her wife requested for them to leave King’s Landing immediately as soon as the bad blood between their families began to boil. He also acknowledged that pursuing Lucerys was his mistake and while he had lost control of his dragon, things wouldn’t have come to this if he had just left well enough alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On most days, he tried to remember Levana’s face when they got married; she was happy and she looked almost ethereal. However, what he kept on seeing in his mind was the sight of her that was sorrowful and angry - it hurt him to no end. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He remembered the day that he </span>
<em>
<span>lost </span>
</em>
<span>her. The anger and the sadness in her eyes haunted him to no end. Aemond could still see it in his dreams - how her gaze upon him would shift from love to anger to sadness in just a short span of time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He yearned for Levana.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He yearned to touch her again, to see her again, to hear her speak again - just a glimpse of her would be enough for him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond, since leaving King’s Landing, often wondered if his wife had given birth already. For some reason, he’d imagine a little princess - one that looked exactly like her mother. He would sometimes imagine their child with their features, each of the images that he managed to conjure seemed too perfect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He doubted if he still deserved that at this point. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prince Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince turned around to see one of the Green Men on an elk, looking down at him. Aemond stood up, “what is it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s been another dragon sighting,” the man said, “it is the Blood Wyrm.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>This was it. </b>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded and walked out of the forest to greet Vhagar who turned to him with a knowing gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We’re heading to Harrenhal, Vhagar,” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond said as he placed a hand on his dragon’s neck, </span>
<em>
<span>“we might not return alive.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vhagar bellowed as Aemond mounted his dragon. He looked towards the direction of Harrenhal before taking a deep breath.</span>

<p>
<span>Levana clutched the sheets of her bed tightly as Maester Priamos instructed her to take deep breaths as she started pushing. Rhaenys held her hand tightly while Laenor watched anxiously from the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Velaryon male wanted to be inside the room when his daughter gave birth but he was forbidden by his mother, Galatea, and Nesrin from entering as it was an event that, supposedly, only the father was invited to witness. Laenor would resign to watching from the door as Levana started to shout curses at the people inside the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was she like this during her first birth?” Laenor asked as Galatea passed by him with a basin of water in her hands. The lady turned to him with a sheepish smile, “if it gives you comfort, she was much younger then and she wasn’t so keen on shouting curses.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea bowed her head before watching into the room and placing the basin beside Maester Priamos. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace,” Priamos began, “you will need all your strength for this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that, bastard!” Levana shouted, “stop being a cunt and just help me!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys chuckled to herself, “there’s my granddaughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor continued to watch as Levana started to shout loudly in pain. He was rarely present during the births of his sons and was only ever there for Levana’s birth; to see the babe that he once carried in his arms be the one giving birth now was a different experience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It made him tear up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment, however, was interrupted by Ser Qarl who walked up to him with a scroll in his hands, “it’s from Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor took the scroll and read its contents. His eyes widened before looking at his lover and then at Levana. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s giving birth,” Laenor said in a panic, “how would I be able to explain this to her?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Qarl shrugged, “their battle has begun,” he stated, “our troops from Harrenhal are keeping an eye on them for now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t know how long the battle will last for,” Laenor sighed, “send King Besian to Harrenhal to help Prince Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Qarl bowed, “right away, Lord Advisor.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor watched as his lover marched quickly to inform the Lord of House Greyjoy about the order. He took a deep breath before walking into the room - just in time for him to hear loud crying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a princess, Your Grace,” Priamos announced, “a new princess for House Targaryen!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana took a deep breath as she looked at her newborn daughter. Tears began to fall from her eyes as the Maester handed the babe to her. The Queen smiled at the princess adoringly - she looked exactly like her father. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rhaenys,” Levana whispered, “her name will be Rhaenys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Princess Rhaenys sat up in shock, “beloved, are you quite sure?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “she will be my heir and she will be Queen after me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The older Targaryen female wrapped her arms around her granddaughter and kissed the top of her head, “thank you, Levana,” she whispered as Laenor cleared his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, father,” Levana smiled, “it’s your granddaughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor wiped a tear from his eye as he sat by Levana’s bed, admiring the babe in his daughter’s arms. Just as he was about to reach for the babe, Levana noticed the scroll in her father’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father?” Levana called, “what is that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Velaryon took his hand back and looked at Rhaenys. Levana looked at her father with worry as she tried to sit up, alerting the maesters immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace,” Priamos stated, “you need to lie back down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Levana responded, “show me the scroll,” she stated as she held her hand out. Laenor begrudgingly unraveled the scroll and handed it to his daughter, “beloved, Aemond has taken it upon himself to protect Harrenhal from Daemon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen skimmed through the contents of the scroll before looking at her grandmother and handing the babe to her, “I’m going to Harrenhal,” she said as she began to get up from her bed. Rhaenys held her great granddaughter as Laenor tried his best to stop Levana from leaving the room.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get out of my way,” Levana hissed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Laenor responded, “beloved, you just gave birth and you need to rest!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked up at her father,</span>
<b> “move away from the door,”</b>
<span> she said, </span>
<b>“that is an order from the Queen.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>The male looked over at Princess Rhaenys who simply nodded her head. Laenor stepped aside as Levana began to head towards her chambers, “Galatea, help me dress,” she ordered as the lady followed after her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My Queen,” Galatea helped Levana walk towards her chamber, “please reconsider this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Levana responded, “Daemon is more experienced in battle than my husband and I know that he is out for our blood,” she gritted her teeth in pain as they arrived in the room. Immediately, Galatea began to set up the Queen’s riding armor while Levana sat on the bed, gathering her strength. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Airell walked inside the room with Levana’s sword in hand, as well as a quiver and a bow. She placed the sword by the bed and offered a bow that seemed to be made from the same material as her whip. It was steel, but it was pliant enough. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if you’re a good shot,” Airell began, “but please allow this to help you,” she said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Airell, I was raised inside the Red Keep and I was forbidden to hold a sword,” Levana responded, “gods be damned that I know how to shoot an arrow.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The other female laughed, “you’ll be a good shot if you want to be a good shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded as she dressed in her armor - a red and gold ensemble that bore the Targaryen sigil on its breast plate. The Queen took a deep breath as she adjusted her armor, a sigh escaping her lips as she began to walk out of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will take my three dragons,” Levana stated, “Seasmoke will remain here,” she instructed as she began to make her way out of the palace. A small smile creeping across her face at the sight of her dragons already waiting for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen placed a hand on Vermithor’s neck before mounting him, </span>
<em>
<span>“it’s time, Vermithor,” </span>
</em>
<span>she whispered, </span>
<em>
<span>“we’re avenging my children today.” </span>

<p>
<span>Aemond flew to Harrenhal with his heart beating loudly against his chest. To say that he was afraid was an understatement as he finally came face to face with his wife's stepfather, Daemon Targaryen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"All alone, kinslayer?" Daemon asked as Aemond glared at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"The only kinslayer here is you," Aemond responded, "you took my wife and children from me!" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon laughed as Caraxes let out a large ball of fire — something that Vhagar was quick to dodge. The Queen of the Dragons retaliated with her own flame, shooting it towards Caraxes and Daemon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"If I took your wife from you, Levana's head would be on a spike," Daemon responded, "it is you who took something from us!" </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I didn’t kill Lucerys,”</b>
<span> Aemond shot back, </span>
<b>“the idea that we control the dragons is an illusion and it always will be.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon laughed as Caraxes flew towards Vhagar, his jaws open in an attempt to bite the shedragon’s neck but the latter was able to avoid him - narrowly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You may not be able to control your dragon,” Daemon chuckled, “but I have control of mine just fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Try flying in the middle of a storm,” Aemond responded, “let’s see how you will fare.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Much better than you,” Daemon said as he tried to reach for Aemond with Dark Sister but Aemond was able to dodge; but he was second too late as the sword had managed to slice through his skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond grunted at the pain but managed to direct Vhagar to fly further away from Aemond as he could. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“Stop running, coward!” </b>
<span>Daemon shouted mockingly, </span>
<b>“this is why Levana left you, you’re a coward!” </b>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, Aemond considered the fact that he might be right but needed to brush off those thoughts as Daemon charged at him again with Dark Sister. The younger prince maneuvered his dragon away from Daemon, giving him just enough time to land his own blow on him - striking him by the arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon winced in pain as he saw the blood running under his armor; the sight made him hiss in anger as he looked up at Aemond who had a small yet visible smirk on his face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll pay for this, usurper!” Daemon shouted as he began his relentless pursuit of Aemond. The latter tried his best to avoid the older prince as the former’s attacks began to become more relentless. What Daemon can’t reach with his sword, he relies on Caraxes to reach for him - at one time, he was able to sink his teeth into Vhagar, earning a loud grumble from the shedragon who retaliated, delivering her own forceful bite on Caraxes. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Vhagar, into the clouds!” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond commanded as Vhagar did exactly that, flying into the clouds to conceal them from the endless pursuit of Daemon and Caraxes. The Rogue Prince could only laugh at the attempt, “how are you going to protect Harrenhal from me if you keep on running awa--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon’s speech was interrupted when his helmet flew off of his head and the sight of Aemond and Vhagar disappearing into the clouds once more. The older prince was livid now - he surely didn’t expect that from Aemond when he was </span>
<em>
<span>clearly </span>
</em>
<span>the better soldier among the two. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the last that you’ll do to me, kinslayer,” Daemon hissed as Caraxes began to fly through the clouds. Daemon’s senses were on a high as he scanned through the clouds for the other prince. In his mind, he knew that Aemond would still be at a disadvantage because of Vhagar’s size - even if he were to launch another attack, all Daemon had to do was to be faster than him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was as if victory was his already.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I have to say, boy,” </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon began, </span>
<em>
<span>“the way that you’re attacking right now reminds me of my own tactics.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond listened in the clouds as Vhagar flew steadily. He rolled his eyes as the other continued to speak. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Are you sure you aren't my son?" </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon laughed,</span>
<em>
<span> "do you want me to confirm the rumors myself right now?" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond continued listening. This was one of the things that continued to haunt him to no end - the fact that he could be a bastard as well would haunt the back of his mind endlessly. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"What if you were my son?" </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon asked, </span>
<em>
<span>"that would make you a bastard yourself, would it not?" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond took in a sharp breath. He didn't know how long he could stay and listen to this but he needed to keep calm - the strike that he was about to do depended on it. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Have you ever wondered why you look differently from Aegon and Helaena?” </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon asked again, </span>
<b>
<em>"it's because you are not of my brother's blood but of mine." </em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>The Rogue Prince laughed maniacally as Aemond felt his blood boil. </span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“You’re a bastard,” </em>
</b>
<span>Daemon revealed, </span>
<b>
<em>“you were never my brother’s son but you are mine.” </em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>“Lies!” Aemond shouted as Vhagar flew toward Daemon; the shedragon wrapping its jaws around Caraxes’ neck as the former took the opportunity to launch his sword towards the former. Daemon narrowly dodged the attack, ending up with a cut but the same couldn't be said for Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Your mother confided in me one night,” </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon revealed, </span>
<em>
<span>“how lonely she was in the Red Keep.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond tried to block out as much as he could but he could only do so much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon swiftly attacked him with Dark Sister, stabbing the prince’s side as Vhagar was forced to let go of Caraxes. Daemon looked at his sword and smiled at the obvious presence of blood on it as Vhagar retreated. Aemond placed a hand on his side, cursing under his breath as he began to feel the pain from the wound. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“When you meet my brother in the afterlife,” </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon chuckled, </span>
<em>
<span>“tell him the truth, will you?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Rogue Prince launched another attack toward Aemond who was able to dodge it. The latter was able to land a blow on Daemon’s arm, cutting through it to make a larger wound - one that effectively hurt Daemon as it was the arm that he used to wield Dark Sister. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll pay for that, </span>
<b>son</b>
<span>,” Daemon laughed as Aemond took to the clouds again but he was met by Caraxes, “your tactics won’t work on me anymore.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vhagar tried to avoid Caraxes but it was to no avail as the Blood Wyrm managed to lunge his teeth into Vhagar’s wing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You die today,” Daemon said as he raised his sword, Aemond doing the same with his own to block the attack that was about to come. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’ll see you in the Seven Hells,” </span>
</em>
<span>Daemon laughed, </span>
<em>
<span>“that is where we both belong, after all.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Daemon was to deliver a mighty swing, an arrow cut through his cheek; allowing Aemond to strike, slicing through his side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon cursed under his breath as he saw three dragons approaching them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It seems like your wife decided to join us,” Daemon said as Aemond turned his head to see Levana with her three dragons flying towards them. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“This makes my job much easier.” </b>

<p>
<span>To say that Queen Levana was nervous was an understatement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana trembled with anxiousness as tried her best to hold onto Vermithor's reins while keeping an eye on Silverwing and Cannibal. She knew that her dragons felt the terrible feeling that she did as well - she felt bad that they had to share her burden but there was nothing that they could do about it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the truth about being a dragonrider.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"I know this too much to ask but I want to save Aemond,"</span>
</em>
<span> Levana sighed, </span>
<em>
<span>"I want to save my husband because I want him to meet Rhaenys." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor bellowed, as if he was telling the Queen not to worry. Silverwing and Cannibal let out similar sounds as they tried to make the flight to Harrenhal faster. Levana was thankful for her dragons - especially Vermithor who had been with her since she was a child. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout their time together, Levana has grown to recognize the different personalities that her dragons have - it was such a joy to watch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor was the calmest of the three, though he remained a fearful front in the presence of those that he didn’t know. Cannibal was just as calm but Levana often considered him to be the shyest as he often spent most of his time alone. Silverwing was the most docile of her dragons, she was gentle and very much approachable - even by other people. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite Cannibal being the largest among the three, Vermithor took the role of an </span>
<em>
<span>alpha</span>
</em>
<span>. Silverwing and Cannibal followed him well and Levana could trust in her dragons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time that they got to Harrenhal, Levana first made sure that whatever was on the ground was dealt with. King Besian arrived on Grey Ghost much earlier than she did so he took care of the bulk of the forces. After giving her orders, Levana quickly directed her attention to the skies where she saw two unmistakable figures of dragons clashing against each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t go near them,” Besian stated, “the two dragons are too big for Grey Ghost.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “stay on the ground and make sure that the Blacks don’t reach the gates,” she stated as Besian nodded. Vermithor then took to the skies with Cannibal and Silverwing following after him. The Queen studied the battle that was happening before her and thought of the best plan of attack that she could do to help Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She held the bow that Airell gave her tightly in her hand before retrieving an arrow from the quiver that was strapped to her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana never handled a sword. She never handled a bow. But by gods, she was willing to do whatever it took to save her husband.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen directed her dragons to come from a farther direction to prevent Caraxes from sensing their arrival. She placed the bow into the arrow and pulled back the bowstring, taking a deep breath as she tried to find Daemon between the two figures. When she found him, she released the arrow, hoping that she would hit the right person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva!” Aemond shouted, “fall back!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head as she disappeared into the skies, leaving Aemond to do the same. Daemon was left laughing to himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will take the both of you down first,” Daemon said, “then I will take the heads of your dragons and deliver them to Rhaenyra.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The only head that’s going to be delivered to her will be yours!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cannibal shot down from the skies, crashing onto Caraxes as Silverwing tried to pull Daemon away from his dragon. Vhagar also joined the cluster, biting onto whatever part that she could reach on Caraxes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon tried to fend off the dragons but he was no match for the three who had come to attack his dragon. He also needed to fend off Aemond who was striking him with his sword.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Rogue Prince only saw one way to escape from the grasp of the dragons and that was to drop. Begrudgingly, he commanded Caraxes to stop flying and to just drop down. The action shocked Aemond who quickly pulled Vhagar away from the cluster with Cannibal and Silverwing following suit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon saw this as his chance to escape but Vermithor appeared from the skies to block his path. Levana had another arrow in her hands as she positioned to shoot, earning a laugh from Daemon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you still believe that you can defeat us?” Daemon asked, “how childish you are, Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not childish,” Levana stated, “childish is you sending assassins in the middle of the night to kill innocent children who had nothing to do with my brother’s death.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond killed Lucerys.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vhagar killed my brother,” Levana corrected, “and that is the truth of it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How cock drunk are you to defend him?” Daemon laughed, “have you forgotten who you really are?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am Levana of House Targaryen,” Levana stated, “I am the Heir to the Iron Throne and I will stop this war no matter what it takes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are a fool if you think that, for one moment, you stood a chance against me,” Daemon grinned, “you’ve never commanded an army and you’ve never fought a war in your life.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I might not have,” Levana stated, “but that’s why I have my Small Council,” she added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They will not be with you forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<b>“I know,”</b>
<span> Levana acknowledged, </span>
<b>“what matters most is that they are with me on the day that I took a stand for the realm.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon gave her a look of disgust as he charged towards her, Levana took another bow in her hand and prepared to launch another arrow towards her stepfather. The Gold Queen released the bowstring that sent an arrow flying towards Daemon, lodging into the Rogue Prince’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I’m right,” Levana took another arrow from her quiver, “Airell made sure that the arrows carry scorpion venom.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is it that Airell Drahar is willing to work with you?” Daemon raised a brow, “your Grandsire, Lord Corlys, stood against her brother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I am not you nor my Grandsire,” Levana responded, “she took my side because I was willing to do the right thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Things will only become right when the rightful heir sits the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The rightful heir is Levana,” Aemond interjected, “my father named her as his heir.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon glared, “there is no other rightful heir than Rhaenyra.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“On his deathbed, King Viserys told me the Song of Ice and Fire,” Levana stated, “he trusted me enough to give me Aegon’s dagger and to carry his will of peace with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There wouldn’t be a war had the usurpers stayed in their lane,” Daemon hissed, “all this began with your husband’s mother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop bringing her into this,” Levana said, “she made her mistakes and she’s paying for them right now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know how much your mother had suffer--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about what I have suffered, Daemon?!” Levana shouted, “if you’re looking for a true victim, you’re speaking to her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon just laughed, “how are you the victim?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have done absolutely nothing, Daemon,” Levana responded, “I have done nothing and yet I have suffered the most.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a pampered palace brat,” Daemon chuckled, “how have you suffered?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I lost my father, I lost my mother, I lost my brothers,” Levana began, “I lost everything that I knew and loved, I even lost my children in a war that I wasn’t even supposed to be involved in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon just raised a brow before launching an attack toward Levana. Cannibal blocked the attack by latching his teeth into Caraxes’ neck. Already, the Blood Wyrm looked weak - it was clear, even to Daemon, that his dragon wouldn’t last long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon Targaryen hung by his dragon’s reins as he looked at Aemond and Levana. He was starting to feel the effects of the scorpion venom creep into his body as he laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to die still, Levana,” Daemon grinned, “if I can’t kill you, Rhaenyra will.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana glared as Silverwing and Vhagar latched their teeth into Caraxes’ wings, tugging at them. The Gold Queen looked at her stepfather with a sigh, “any last words?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have nothing to say to you,” Daemon hissed as Cannibal snapped Caraxes’ neck while Silverwing and Vhagar pulled off its wings. The Rogue Prince was sent spiraling down into Gods’ Eye. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I want his body,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana commanded as Silverwing dove down into the water. The Queen turned to her husband and pointed towards Harrenhal, “I want to see your wound.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m perfectly fine,” Aemond said as he winced in pain. His wife raised a brow as she turned to Vhagar, </span>
<em>
<span>“your rider is stubborn, please land.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen of the Dragons grumbled and followed Levana’s orders, landing by the castle. The Queen unmounted from her dragon as Aemond did the same. The prince was about to wrap his arms around her but the Queen took a stepback.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saved you because you were fighting to defend one of my sworn houses,” Levana stated, “that doesn’t mean that I have forgiven you.” </span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">【𝟖𝟒】</h2>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Aemond was relieved to see his wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He couldn’t touch her or be too affectionate with her but to be in her presence was enough for him. Just the sight of her gave him relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fortunately, I think your wound isn’t too deep,” Levana stated, “we can make it to the Iron Islands so Maester Priamos can take a look at you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can stay here,” Aemond stated, “I’ll look after Harrenhal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Adorable,” Levana chuckled, “but I don’t want you to die.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Aemond was about to respond, Silverwing emerged from the lake with Daemon’s body in her jaws. Levana approached the dragon, stroking her neck as he let go of the Rogue Prince; the paleness in his body confirmed that he was, in fact, dead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana noticed that he still had Dark Sister clutched in his hands. She knelt down beside his body to remove the sword in his hands before taking it. The princess looked at her stepfather before raising the sword and slicing through Daemon’s neck, his head rolling off his body cleanly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause before Levana raised Dark Sister and began to stab Daemon’s headless body with the sword. She was sobbing and shouting as she did so; Aemond quickly ran towards his wife, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her close to him. The prince took Dark Sister from his wife’s hand and threw it aside as he pulled her away from her stepfather’s body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Aemond whispered, “I know,” he repeated as Levana cried in his arms. He understood why she was crying and why she was angry - this was the man that took everything from her and still, Daemon Targaryen wasn’t satisfied with what he took from his wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Daemon wanted more and now, his pursuit ended in his own demise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond leaned against Vhagar as he held Levana tightly. They stayed like that for a few moments before the female finally stood up and began to walk back to Daemon’s head. She took Dark Sister from the ground as he watched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva,” Aemond called as the Queen took a piece of wood from the ground and mounted Daemon’s head on it. There were tears in her eyes as she walked towards Cannibal who was presently enjoying his meal - Caraxes’ body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At the sight of his rider, the dragon lowered his neck so Levana could get on his saddle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mount of your dragon,” Levana looked at Aemond, “Vermithor and Silverwing will lead you to Pyke.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yourself?” Aemond asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to deliver Daemon’s head to Dragonstone,” Levana stated, “I promised my mother that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will fly with you,” Aemond offered but Levana just glared at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you’re going to go to Pyke and wait for my return,” Levana stated, “I will not have you flying with me there because that would mean that I have to look after my injured husband.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond was taken aback by his wife’s statement but relented, nonetheless. He mounted Vhagar as Levana flew away on Cannibal. The prince turned his head to watch his wife fly away and took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned to Vermithor who visibly had a scowl on his wife while Silverwing kept her eyes on the skies. It was clear that Levana’s dragons truly didn’t appreciate his presence. Vhagar knew this so the shedragon maintained a clear distance from the two dragons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond could only hope that Levana was going to return properly. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The flight to Dragonstone was shorter than Levana wanted it to be but when you’re riding one of the largest dragons in the world, that was expected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She passed by Driftmark and a few ships from her Grandsire’s fleet that attempted to strike her dragon down but Cannibal dealt with them rather quickly, engulfing them in flames before landing on the beaches of Dragonstone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she arrived, Lord Corlys and Jacaerys were standing at the beach as if waiting for her arrival. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Queen Rhaenyra?” Levana asked, “I have something for her,” she said as she placed the spike that carried Daemon’s head on the sand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve given birth?” Lord Corlys asked as Levana nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The babe is a girl,” Levana revealed, “I named her after my grandmother, Princess Rhaenys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Sea Snake smiled at his granddaughter and so did Jacaerys who had a proud smile on his face. Just as the prince was about to speak, Rhaenyra emerged from behind them - at once, her eyes darted toward Daemon’s head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You killed your stepfather,” Rhaenyra stated, “just like your husband, you are a kinslayer.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I?” Levana chuckled, “have you told your Small Council about what Daemon Targaryen did to my children?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baelon and Aemma?” Lord Corlys turned to Rhaenyra, “what happened to my grandchildren?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“After Lucerys’ death, Daemon sent assailants to murder both of my children,” Levana revealed, “I do not know how much my mother has told any of you with regards to that matter but that is the truth.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why have you come, Levana?” Rhaenyra asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here to deliver Daemon’s head,” Levana smiled slightly, “I recall promising you that I would come back with his head on a spike.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra was speechless. She looked at Lord Corlys and then at Jacaerys before looking behind her to see that Baela had come from the castle to join them. Members of her Small Council also stood by and watched the exchange. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I am Queen Levana of House Targaryen,” </b>
<span>Levana stated, </span>
<b>“I am the rightful heir to the Iron Throne as proclaimed by my Grandsire, King Viserys, on his deathbed.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana, stop this at once,” Rhaenyra commanded but the other Queen glared at her plainly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is an open invitation to everyone that you are welcome at the Iron Islands,” Levana began, “you need not fight for my cause but if you seek refuge, we will welcome you,” she added as she mounted her dragon once more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And should you wish to discuss terms of surrender, Queen Rhaenyra,” Levana looked at her mother before turning to Lord Corlys with a small smile, “my adviser, Lord Laenor Velaryon and my Hand, Princess Rhaenys, would be more than happy to have a conference with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cannibal took to the skies as Rhaenyra watched Levana disappear into the clouds. At once, Lord Corlys began to bombard the Black Queen with questions - as did the other members of her Small Council but Rhaenyra had blocked them all out as she continued to look at the skies and at Daemon’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was very clear to her now that she had lost Levana. Rhaenyra held hope that she would be able to reunite with her daughter after the war but it’s certain that what she hoped for wasn’t going to happen anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana had chosen her own path and as much as Rhaenyra respected that, it meant that she would be making an enemy of her own mother. The Black Queen wasn’t ready for that but it was clear to her that Levana wasn’t going to back down anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Greens are no longer a threat. </span>
</p><p>
<b>This was their war now.</b>

<p>
<span>The flight to Pyke felt like the shortest that Levana has ever flown. So many things were coming into her mind at once and it felt as though she blacked out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn't even remember arriving at Pyke and unmounting from her dragon. The next thing that she remembered was being escorted to her chambers by her father and Galatea waiting for her with a bath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she came to, Levana was sitting inside the tub with her knees pulled up to her chest. She noticed the amount of steam coming from the tub but paid no heed to it, it felt like regular water to her. It was only then that she noticed how sore her body was - she deduced that it was because of giving birth earlier in the day followed by the strenuous fight with Daemon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana felt comfort in the water. It was as if she was being embraced by the heat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea came in a few moments later with a towel in hand and noticed that the steam had yet to subside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Grace?" Galatea called, "are you quite alright?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to her and nodded slightly, "the water feels tepid."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The response took Galatea by shock, "Your Grace, that is the hottest that the water can go." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at the water again and sighed, "how is Aemond?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea took a seat beside the tub and looked at the Queen, "he's being treated for his wounds and the Small Council is presently discussing what to do with him." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Without me?" Levana asked, "why would they decide to do this without me?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They're thinking of options that they can present to you, My Queen," Galatea explained, "they are not planning to act but they are simply thinking of options." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I hope that execution isn't one of them," Levana said, "I will not have my husband executed." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea took a deep breath, “Airell did bring that up, Your Grace, but it was deflected by the Lady Hand and Ser Harrold.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are Viserys and Aegon?” Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re asking for their mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know they would ask for her,” the Gold Queen sighed, “it was only a matter of time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re asking for you,” Galatea corrected, “they’ve been asking for the dragon mother who brought them here and they’ve been relentless in doing so that Airell was forced to look after them,” she chuckled slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never imagined Airell to be good with children,” Levana said in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On the contrary, Your Grace,” Galatea smiled, “Airell has four of her own,” she continued as Levana turned her head to face the former. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Four?” Levana repeated, “then she should be with them right now and not risk her life for this cause.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s because of them that she decided to fight for your case,” Galatea said as she stood up and spread the towel in her hands. Levana got up from the bath and immediately, the cold wrapped around her body causing her to shiver. Galatea wrapped the towel around Levana’s body as the Queen walked back into her chambers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Rhaenys?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The young princess is resting well,” Galatea reported, “your father refused to leave her side when you went to Harrenhal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s good to hear,” Levana mused, “he deserves as much after not being able to meet Aemma and Baelon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea nodded as she began to help the princess get dressed. Levana turned her attention to the sword that was leaning against the wall and glared, “was I the one who brought Dark Sister here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace,” Galatea sighed, “you wouldn’t let anyone touch it when you arrived.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana remained silent as she finished dressing. The Queen took a seat in front of her dresser as Galatea began to do quick work on the princess’ hair, braiding it the same way that she used to when the princess was much younger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened, Your Grace?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen looked at her reflection in the mirror, “I killed Daemon and I delivered his head on a spike to my mother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea didn’t speak as Levana just stared blankly at the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<b>“What I did was an ugly thing,”</b>
<span> Levana sighed,</span>
<b> “but I feel no remorse for it at all.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>There was a slight pause as Galatea tried to figure out what to reply to her Queen when Levana turned to her with tears in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace,” Galatea knelt in front of Levana, holding her hands tightly in hers, “you don’t need to feel anything about it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana just continued to cry. There was a feeling inside her that was bubbling inside - a feeling that she couldn’t shake off. It wasn’t guilt, nor was it sadness, but she felt almost empty.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This was the first time that you experienced doing something like that, Your Grace,” Galatea said, “you did what was the right thing for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what’s right for you isn’t necessarily the right thing for everyone else.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to the doors to see Aemond, leaning against the door frame. He donned a white undershirt; the bandage across his torso peeking through the shirt as he walked inside the room. Levana noticed that he wasn’t wearing his eyepatch, for that, she couldn’t help but stare.  When he got closer to them, Galatea immediately stood up and walked in front of Levana with a glare on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<b>“You’re not allowed to see the Queen.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“No one told me that,” Aemond raised a brow, “was that an order from the Queen herself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana cleared her throat, “I wish to speak to my husband,” she stated, “alone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace-” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana, who nodded her head, cut Galatea off. The Lady couldn’t do anything except sigh and leave the room, closing the doors behind her. Once he was sure that they were alone, Aemond looked at his wife, who was still staring at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“May I approach you?” Aemond asked, “am I allowed to approach you now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen nodded as the male smiled to himself. He knelt in front of Levana and looked up at her, “you’re as beautiful as the day that I married you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flattery will get you nowhere,” Levana said, “why have you come?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to see how you were,” Aemond responded, “am I not allowed to do that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana sighed a response, “how is your wound?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Healing,” Aemond responded, “Maester Priamos said the same thing as you did so I think I will survive.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled, “good because Rhaenys and his brothers are dying to meet you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rhaenys?” Aemond raised a brow, “brothers…?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen nodded plainly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You bore three children?” Aemond’s eyes widened in shock, “I must have done something to please the gods.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not give birth to three children,” Levana corrected, “Rhaenys is our trueborn daughter and her brothers are adopted.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“From where?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Gullet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana, you can’t be serious,” Aemond looked at his wife in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am,” Levana smiled, “and they call me mother now.” </span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">【𝟖𝟔】</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>"My love," Aemond sighed, "if you wanted more children, all you had to do was ask."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"You need not accept Aegon and Viserys as your own," Levana said, standing up from her seat and walking towards the balcony. The scene felt so similar to Aemond yet he felt anything but nostalgic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to tell them who their real mother and father are?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “I’m not cruel,” she said, “when they are at the age that they can understand these things, I will tell them who their real mother and father are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They might think you’ve deceived them,” Aemond said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s their decision,” Levana sighed, “but right now, I am doing the best possible thing for them in this war and that is to protect them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Rhaenys?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just said that she was your trueborn daughter,” Levana glared, “and you cannot deny her when she looks exactly like you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How so?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When she scowls,” Levana laughed as she approached Aemond, placing a hand on his face as she looked up at him. The male stood still, taking in the sight of his wife whom he missed dearly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed you,” Levana confessed, “I worry about you everyday.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As do I,” Aemond responded as he wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her closer, “I think of you everyday.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond,” Levana sighed, “I don’t know if I have forgiven you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Aemond responded as he leaned his forehead against hers, “and I will wait for you, no matter how long it takes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you thought of me everyday,” Levana chuckled, “what else?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince smirked, “I didn’t expect the Queen to be a vixen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I simply asked a question,” Levana responded, “you are the one who thought of it differently.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you allow me to show you how much I missed you then,” Aemond asked, “My Queen?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Levana was about to reply, the doors to her chambers burst open to reveal her father with the children in tow. Laenor looked at the two with a glare as Viserys and Aegon waddled into the room, looking up at Aemond; they both hid behind Laenor who sighed a response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I apologize, My Queen, for interrupting whatever this is,” Laenor cleared his throat, “but Rhaenys is restless and these two have been asking for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled as she knelt on the floor and spread her arms, “come.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon and Viserys hurriedly rushed to Levana’s arms, hiding their faces on her shoulder as Laenor walked up to Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Allow me to be clear,” Laenor said, “I don’t trust you but you are the father,” he continued as he handed Rhaenys gently to Aemond before walking towards the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are to have a gathering tonight, Your Grace,” Laenor stated, “the Small Council wishes to speak with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levena looked up at her father and nodded with a smile. The Velaryon male bowed his head before leaving the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is he?” Aegon whispered as Levana smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is my husband, Aemond,” Levana responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is he our father?” Viserys asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only if you want me to be,” Aemond responded, “just like how she is your mother because you chose to call her that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He sounds mean,” Aegon said as he looked up at Levana, “I don’t like him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chose to ignore the comment from the younger boy as he looked at the babe in his arms. When Levana told him that their daughter looked like him, he wasn’t so sure - but he can very much see the resemblance now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dragon mother,” Aegon called, “where did you go?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dragon mother?” Aemond raised a brow, “you allow them to call you that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t let them call me mother,” Levana responded, “dragon mother is the alternative.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who taught them to call you that?” Aemond asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Airell Drahar,” Levana responded, “she likes to spend her free time with them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s hard to imagine the Scorpion Queen being familiar with kids,” Aemond said as he took a seat on the bed, gently rocking the babe in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came to discover that she had children of her own,” Levana smiled as she stood up. The boys followed after her as she took a seat beside Aemond on the bed. The Queen gazed upon their daughter who slept peacefully in her father’s arms while the two little boys looked at Rhaenys as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rhaenys looks like you,” Viserys pointed at Aemond, “but not scary.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take it as a compliment,” Levana whispered as the two younger boys continued to dote on the infant. Aemond turned to his wife who smiled gently at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to beg for your forgiveness or your trust,” Aemond said, “but I am going to work for it, Eva.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled slightly, “shame, I was looking forward to your begging.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe I can beg in some other way,” Aemond winked as Aegon looked up at him with a small glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t hurt our dragon mother!” Aegon pouted, “or Cannibal will eat you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt Cannibal would enjoy me as a meal, Aegon,” Aemond rolled his eye, “he only likes dragons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Last I checked,” Levana smiled slightly, “all Targaryens are dragons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince looked at Levana with a shocked expression. She was right; he told her that before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Children,” Levana stood up from the bed before walking to take Rhaenys from Aemond, “why don’t we look for Airell?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Viserys and Aegon immediately went to Levana’s side; both of them began to talk about how Airell Drahar would look after them and tell stories about Essos - her residence before the war began. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall I join you?” Aemond asked but Levana shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If my Small Council were to see you with me, I imagine they wouldn’t like it very much,” Levana chuckled as she opened the door, the two boys pouring out of the room first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Make no mistake, Aemond,” The Queen turned to face her husband, “you are not a guest here, in fact, you are a prisoner.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond looked at his wife, “I understand.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I may love you still,” Levana began, “but, for now, I have chosen to set my emotions aside to better serve the realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana began to make her way out of the room, following after the two boys who would make it a point to check every open door to see if the person they were looking for was inside one of the rooms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond walked out of the room after Levana, watching as she disappeared through the hallways. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His wife was a different person now. While he was proud of what his wife was trying to achieve, there was fear in his heart that his wife would be pushed further away from him during the onslaught of the war. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond would have to make the most of it. At least, until the Gold Council decides his fate. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>It was late in the evening when Levana gathered with her advisors and Small Council in front of the Painted Table. Galatea placed a goblet of wine in front of the Queen before taking her seat beside Laenor towards Levana’s left. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have been in discussion on what to do with Prince Aemond Targaryen,” Rhaenys began, “because of the insistence of our Lord Commander of the Queensguard and myself, we have ruled out any punishment that would equate to death.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That includes gouging his other eye out,” Airell huffed in disappointment, “the Lady Hand forbade that as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is your consensus?” Levana asked, “have you come to an agreement on what to do with Aemond?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He can fight for the cause,” Laenor began, “but he can’t do so on dragonback.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond is a capable dragonrider,” Levana defended, “and we need Vhagar.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what Besian and I said,” Prince Sorin leaned forward, “Vhagar is still one of the largest dragons in the realms and we need her if we’re going to capture the capital!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Queen Levana,” Nesrin called, “if I may?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded as Lady Strong stood up to examine the Painted Table, “Queen Helaena and her children are still in King’s Landing, yes?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Levana responded, “I don’t think Otto Hightower has any intention of leaving the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if,” Nesrin began, “we sent Prince Aemond back to the Red Keep to retrieve Queen Helaena and her children?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mean to send my husband on a suicide mission?” Levana asked, “they have branded him a traitor the moment that he left the capital."</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That would be a good way to prove his loyalty to you,” Nesrin said, “by sending him back to where he came.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’ll die the moment that he sets foot in King’s Landing without Vhagar.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not if he knows the passages,” Galatea brought up, “but he probably has no knowledge of that when Queen Levana didn’t either.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I forbid it,” Levana stated firmly, “you said you have ruled out every other punishment that would equate to death and yet you want me to consider this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The other alternative was to send him to Dragonstone,” Laenor said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I forbid that as well,” Levana responded, “the Blacks still think that Aemond killed my younger brother and I delivered Daemon’s head on spike to them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps if one or two of us decided to accompany Prince Aemond to the capital, it would be a much easier task,” Galatea said as she turned to Ser Nandor who stood by the doors. The knight walked towards the table and stood beside Galatea’s seat, bowing his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nandor,” Sorin began, “you can’t be serious.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know those passages,” Nandor said, “so does Lady Galatea and we are their best bet to slip into King’s Landing undetected.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not going back there, Galatea,” Besian spoke, “it was already a challenge to get you out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I only got out because of the Queen,” Galatea reminded, “I don’t mind going back inside if she wants me to.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I just said that I forbade it," Levana looked at her Small Council in disbelief, "are you all not listening to me?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Grace," Laenor sighed, "this is a chance to infiltrate King's Landing." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not to the expense of a knight of the Queensguard, one of my advisors, and my husband," Levana responded, "try again." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well then, Your Grace,” Laenor turned to his daughter, “what do you ought to do?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I already sent a raven with instructions to Rhaena and she will meet you at Harrenhal,” Jacaerys stated as he led Baela through the woods and to the Dragonmont where Moondancer was resting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you and Joffrey?” Baela asked as she pulled her coat closer to her, “why don’t you just come with us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys turned to his betrothed and shook his head, “I need to be here and my mother would throw a fit if anything happened to Joffrey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When are you going to join us?” Baela asked, “I’m sure Ana would prefer that the four of us go together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t go together, Baela,” Jacaerys said, “it will be much safer for you and Rhaena as well if I didn’t come with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What will happen when we reach Harrenhal?” Baela asked, “Ana won’t know that we’d be coming.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys took a deep breath, “show your Velaryon sigils to the people at Harrenhal and give them this,” he said as he handed a scroll to Baela, “this is my letter to Ana.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jacaerys," Baela placed a hand on the prince's shoulder, "you have to swear to me that you will join us in Harrenhal or wherever soon." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys sighed and nodded slightly. In truth, he also doubted if he'd be able to join them — he was dead set on the fact that he was not going to survive the siege of the capital. Moondancer, Baela’s mount, approached them with a low grumble as the female looked at Jacaerys one more time, pleading for him to escape with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When Levana sees you, tell her that the siege of King’s Landing is to happen in ten days time,” Jacaerys stated, “that should be enough time for my sister and her forces to travel from the Iron Islands to King’s Landing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please stay alive,” Baela requested, “please don’t let Levana lose another brother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll try my best,” Jacaerys promised, “but I cannot swear to it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The female sighed and mounted Moondancer. Baela gave Jacaerys one last look before commanding her dragon to take flight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys watched as her betrothed took to the sky and disappeared into the clouds. The prince took in a deep breath as he began to walk back to the castle. His heart skipped a beat in nervousness as Lord Corlys stood by the entrance, looking into the woods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Baela?” Lord Corlys asked as Jacaerys approached. The prince remained silent as he continued his trek back into the castle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What you did is treason,” Lord Corlys stated, “but it is the right thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys stopped in his tracks before turning his head to look at his Grandsire who bowed his head, “thank you for finding a way to get Baela out of harm's way,” Lord Corlys said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s the least I could do,” Jacaerys responded, “Ana would’ve done the same thing.” </span>

<span>“My men have alerted me that the Blacks are advancing towards the capital,” Airell pursed her lips, “Besian and I instructed our fleet to fortify whatever we have on the Stepstones, the Gullet, and across the Narrow Sea.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ser Qarl also took a thousand of our men to Harrenhal,” Laenor reported, “we’ll be sending a thousand more in a few nights.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dorne remains safe,” Sorin said, “we have watchers looking over the Sea of Dorne and we’ve managed to barricade our borders from The Reach and Storm’s End.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The emergency fleet is also at standby,” Besian said, “they will be in-charge of taking the children and Airell back to Essos should something happen during the war.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana listened to her Small Council intently; there were so many things that she was heavily considering. From what to do when the Blacks decide to do a direct attack down to how they’re going to evacuate King’s Landing before an actual fight breaks out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything needed to be planned. A small mistake could be critical.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can take the capital now,” Airell stated, “they wouldn’t see it coming.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If the Blacks also plan to take the capital now, it’ll be chaos,” Laenor responded, “if we attack at the same time they do, we won’t be able to evacuate the capital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Many lives will be lost,” Rhaenys said, “we cannot risk it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was dead silence in the room. No one dared to talk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only when the doors burst open to reveal one of the maesters that served under Maester Priamos did sound come back to the room. Priamos stood up from his seat to address his underling who handed a scroll to him. The Grand Maester read through the scroll quickly before looking at the Queen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace,” Priamos approached Levana and handed her the scroll, “Ladies Baela and Rhaena have found their way to Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Princess Rhaenys leaned forward as Levana gave the scroll to her grandmother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No Jacaerys or Joffrey?” Laenor asked as Priamos shook his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Black will seize the capital in ten days,” Priamos announced, “if we are to rally our forces, we need to act now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana thought for a while before getting up from her seat and walking towards the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace?” Priamos called. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be needing my Small Council in Harrenhal,” Levana stated, “if we are to fight the Blacks in ten days' time, we should be in a location that’s much closer to the capital.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about the children?” Laenor asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The children will remain here,” Levana stated, “with the maesters.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Prince Aemond?” Besian asked, “what about him and Vhagar?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll bring them to Harrenhal,” Levana responded, “we need them to win this war.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Laenor looked at his daughter, “we aren’t so sure about his loyalty at this point.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father,” The Queen sighed, “let’s not forget who decided to stay in Harrenhal to defend the stronghold from Daemon Targaryen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a bit of silence in the room as Levana began to make her way out of the room. She looked back at the room and raised a brow, “I just said that I needed my Small Council to be in Harrenhal, why isn’t anyone moving?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the members of the Small Council began to scramble out of the room. Levana made her way to her chambers; pushing the doors open to reveal Aemond, sitting on one of her couches with closed eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled slightly. He looked peaceful this way - it’s been a long time since she’s seen him like this and it brought back memories of years ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Paint a picture, Your Grace,” Aemond chuckled, “it would last longer.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana closed the doors behind her as she walked towards her bed, “we’re going to Harrenhal soon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harrenhal?” Aemond raised a brow, “are we finally attacking King’s Landing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes and no,” Levana responded, “my sisters are in Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And your brothers?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen simply shook her head, “I would like to believe that Jacaerys took it upon himself to find a way for Baela and Rhaena to arrive in Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about the children?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The children will be left here with the maesters,” Levana stated, “we cannot bring them to Harrenhal with us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was silence between the two of them before Aemond stood up and walked towards the doors; he paused before placing his hand on the handles. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I will fight for you,”</span>
</em>
<span> Aemond said,</span>
<em>
<span> “Vhagar and I will fight for you.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled, </span>
<em>
<span>“I have no doubt that you would,” </span>
</em>
<span>she looked up at him, </span>
<em>
<span>“regardless of what has happened, I know that there is still love for me in your heart.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“My love for you will never fade,” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond turned to look at her, </span>
<em>
<span>“I will choose to die a thousand deaths so I could be reborn in your arms again.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen smiled, </span>
<em>
<span>“when we both survive this war, would you like to try again?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded, </span>
<em>
<span>“my answer to you, Queen Levana, will always be yes.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Even if I ask you to die for me?” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana asked, </span>
<em>
<span>“will your answer still be yes?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond turned towards the door again and opened it ever so slightly, </span>
<em>
<span>“you shouldn’t be asking me that because I will do it without question.”  </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Aemond was to leave the room, Levana stood up from her bed and placed a hand on his shoulder. The prince turned to his wife with a small smile on his face before turning so his eye could meet hers. The prince closed the distance between them and placed his forehead against Levana’s. He wrapped an arm around her waist to pull her closer to him. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You are the best of me, Levana,” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond whispered, </span>
<em>
<span>“and if I am to die tomorrow, I will fight whoever rules the Seven Hells so they will bring me back to you.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you be able to bear being called a traitor by your own mother? Brother?” Levana asked, “Grandsire?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are my family,” Aemond stated, “whatever they think of me matters less now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In truth, Aegon cursed that we would both die in the war,” Aemond sighed, “I should want to see them try to bring us down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled in amusement as she wrapped her arms around her husband’s neck. Aemond embraced his wife tightly - as if not wanting to let her go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the calm before the storm. </span>

<strong>“Presenting Queen Levana of House Targaryen, First of Her Name, Queen of the Rhoynar, the Andals, and the First Men, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm, and the Mother of Dragons!” </strong>
</p><p>
<span>Levana cringed slightly as she entered Harrenhal’s Great Hall. A part of her wishes that the <em>“Mother of Dragons”</em> bit in her title would be omitted but Sorin insisted that it should be part of her title as that’s what people </span>
<b>needed </b>
<span>to know her by. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana commanded three of the largest dragons in the realms. She originally claimed four but has relented ownership of Grey Ghost to Besian to have more dragonriders in her cause. Sorin was adamant that she had to be known as the </span>
<b>Mother of Dragons</b>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Two figures stood at the end of the hall. With relief in her heart, Levana ran to them as Baela and Rhaena turned and ran to meet their eldest sister halfway. Immediately, the Queen wrapped her arms tightly around them and brought them to the floor. The three women were in tears as Baela and Rhaena embraced Levana tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I would never see the two of you again,” Levana spoke as she removed herself from the embrace to look at her sisters. She wiped their tears before embracing them again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It brings us so much relief to see you, Ana,” Baela said, “and you’ve given birth as well!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana broke the embrace again and nodded, “the babe is a girl and I’ve chosen to name her Rhaenys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is grandmother with you?” Rhaena asked, “Jacaerys mentioned in his letter that grandmother and Uncle Laenor are alive.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They will arrive shortly,” Levana said, “my riders and I flew on dragonback so we could scout the area first before the entourage arrived.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is your husband with you?” Baela inquired, “is he fighting for us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana pursed her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t asked him yet,” Levana sighed, “there’s much that my husband and I still need to talk about.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baela, Rhaena!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The three royals stood from the floor as Princess Rhaenys rushed to embrace all three of them. For the first in a long time, the Queen Who Never Was felt that her family was complete. Tears fell from her eyes as she embraced her granddaughters tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I had lost you,” Rhaenys said, “but I have gained all three of my granddaughters back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled slightly. Her sisters were with her now but her brothers weren’t and above all else, she worried most for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause before Aemond approached them. He had forgone wearing his eyepatch since the day that he arrived at Pyke; it made him feel more vulnerable, but that was exactly how he felt around his wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond Targaryen was at his most vulnerable when he’s with Levana.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Brother,” Baela greeted, “it brings me joy to see that you’re with Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It brings me great joy to see you well,” Aemond smiled slightly, “I shall help Lord Laenor with preparations of the Small Council chambers, if you’d excuse me,” he bowed his head before leaving the females in the Great Hall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can tell that he’s trying,” Rhaena smiled, “he wouldn’t be trying this hard if he wasn’t madly in love with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In her heart, she loved him the same way. However, the circumstances that surrounded their relationship were much different from how it began. They both needed to adjust to their new circumstances, just as Levana needed to adjust to becoming a monarch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What of your daughter, Ana?” Baela asked, “will Rhaena and I get the chance to meet her first?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head sadly, “I made the decision to leave her and my adoptive sons in my seat at Pyke.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Adoptive sons?” Rhaena asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys turned to Levana before taking a deep breath, “you will have to tell them one day.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded as Rhaenys began to walk out of the room. The Queen turned to her sister and sighed, “it's Aegon and Viserys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re alive?!” Baela said in shock, “that’s a relief!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m taking them in for now,” Levana said, “they need family the most at this stage of the war and even if I don’t survive, I know that they’ll be well taken care of.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As long as they are out of harm’s way,” Rhaena began, “at least they won’t be in the middle of the war when the Black Queen takes King’s Landing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana dreaded that. It was only a matter of days before she would have to retaliate against Queen Rhaenyra. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you excuse me, sisters,” Levana looked at Rhaena and Baela, “I shall retreat to my room as we have a meeting tonight to discuss battle plans.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two Velaryon ladies nodded and curtsied to the Queen. Rhaenys gave her a nod as Levana began to walk out of the Great Hall. There was uneasiness in her heart as she walked through the halls of Harrenhal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were so close to King’s Landing now that if Aegon still had the will for it, he could send soldiers to attack them at any moment. There was also the impending threat of her mother sending assassins to attack them. While she believed that her mother was well above sending killers, a large part of her begged to differ as it was assassins that took her own children from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At this point, Levana believed that her mother was capable of anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned her head to see Aemond walking towards her. The Queen bunched her eyebrows as she looked at her husband with confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you just call me Ana?” Levana asked, “you never call me that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond walked up to her and bowed his head slightly, “I thought I would get used to it as that is what your family calls you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like it when you call me Eva,” Levana confessed, “it was always something that I associate you with.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince chuckled, “where are you off to, Your Grace?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My chambers,” The Queen stated, “to clear my head.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you allow me to escort you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prince Aemond,” Levana chuckled, “I would be greatly offended if you didn’t.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond smiled slightly as he offered his hand to the Queen who began to walk ahead. The male could only laugh at himself slightly as he followed behind his wife. He could feel the tension in the air as he observed Levana. He knew that there was a lot in his wife’s head; if only he could somewhat take away a bit of the burden. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrived in Levana’s chambers, the Queen laid down on one of the couches. Aemond sat on the Queen’s bed as Levana took her crown off of her head and placed it on the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s much in your head, I can feel it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to Aemond with a chuckle, “what gave it away?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re too silent for my taste,” Aemond said, “if there is one thing that I learned about you, it's that you become exceedingly silent when something is in your head.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “it’s this war.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll be fine,” Aemond said, “I might have no right to tell you that but I believe that we will be alright.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled slightly, “you said that as well and then we lost both of our children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then I have absolutely no right to tell you that everything will be fine,” Aemond chuckled nervously, “I dream about them sometimes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As do I,” Levana confessed, “sometimes I see them as phantom figures as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I miss them,” Aemond said, “there isn’t a day that I don’t regret what happened and what I did to lead to it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That will not bring our children back,” Levana said, “I may forgive you for what you have done but that won’t bring them back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Aemond looked down, “I live in regret everyday.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How I wish I could share your burden,” Levana took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Aemond stood up from the bed and walked towards Levana. He knelt in front of his wife and took her hands in his. He brought her hands to his lips and placed a kiss on her knuckles before looking up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is I that wishes to share your burden,” Aemond said, “I have done less of that and I want to share it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at her husband, “you need not share them but I wish for you to be by my side.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I will,” Aemond said, “I will never leave your side now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you swear it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear it.”</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>“Will you marry me again?” Aemond asked, “I would like to marry you again when I have earned your trust again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled and leaned forward to place a kiss on his forehead, “will you marry me in Dragonstone? Like you said before?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will marry you in Dragonstone,” Aemond said, “I will marry you there, in Driftmark, in Pyke, and even in Dorne, if you will it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen chuckled and looked into her husband’s eye. She placed one of her hands on his cheek, “when my father told me that you were off to battle Daemon, I felt my heart sink.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would never lose to Daemon,” Aemond chuckled, “he can try.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I was going to lose you,” Levana said, “I don’t want to lose the man that I love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will never lose me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is serious, Aemond,” Levana chuckled, “I wasn’t about to let Daemon take you as well when he’s taken so much from me already.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond kept silent as he looked at her. There was truly something mesmerizing about his wife that even he couldn’t describe. Even from when they were much younger, the prince believed that there was something different about Levana Velaryon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When we win against the Blacks,” Levana began, “I  want to keep the name Velaryon if I am to take the throne.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think that to be wise?” Aemond asked, “people expect a Targaryen ruler.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am still a Targaryen,” Levana said, “I am still from the House, but I want to keep my maiden name.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see no problem with it but you would have to consult your Small Council,” Aemond said, “though I have doubt that they’ll have much to say.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yourself? What about your own title?” Levana asked, “you have every right to demand your title as King.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond simply chuckled, “until my Queen is seated on the throne, my title doesn’t matter.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel as though a younger Aemond would challenge you to a sword fight if he heard that,” Levana chuckled, “perhaps we </span>
<b>have </b>
<span>matured throughout this ordeal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would beat him in one, that’s for sure,” Aemond responded, “I’d give him a beating as well for hurting our wife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps it is he who will give you a beating,” Levana chuckled a response, “a much younger you would have chosen to flee King’s Landing with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“Dragons do not flee.”</b>
</p><p>
<b>“Do not give me that shit,”</b>
<span> Levana glared,</span>
<b> “that’s what got us into this mess in the first place.” </b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Are you saying that our traditions are wrong?” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond asked.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m saying that our traditions are outdated,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana said, </span>
<em>
<span>“dragons fled from Valyria during the Doom, did they not?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond was silent. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I asked you a question,” </span>
</em>
<span>The Queen raised a brow, </span>
<em>
<span>“am I wrong?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana, this is a different time,” Aemond reasoned, “Valyria was on the brink of destruction.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our family is on the brink of destruction,” Levana spat back, “the House of the Dragon will bring itself down if this fight ensues.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond resigned to keep his mouth shut. He stood up and walked towards the balcony, peering out of it. In his mind, he knew that there was truth to what his wife was saying. While his Targaryen pride swelled in his heart - things might be different now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe Levana was right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That still doesn’t erase the fact that we’re already in this war,” Aemond said as he turned to Levana again, “and that we have to fight regardless.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wonder why…" Levana trailed off with a small smile on her face, "sometimes, I dream about Lucerys too and he's standing by the shore of Driftmark with the widest smile on his face." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond took a deep breath, "is there something more to it?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I see Aemma and Baelon running towards him and embracing him," Levana added, "at the very least, it brings me comfort to know that our children are being cared for by their uncle in the next life." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speaking of your brothers,” Aemond sighed, “are they joining us soon?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head, “I feel as though they decided to stay with my mother for her sake.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything has always been for your mother’s sake,” Aemond said, “from the very beginning, it was always for your mother and look where it’s gotten her now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just as I told Daemon before I took his head,” Levana took a deep breath, “I have done absolutely nothing and yet I have suffered the most.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond looked at his wife, truly, she was a different woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The gods have chosen me to suffer,” Levana chuckled to herself, “and for what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva,” Aemond walked towards her again, kneeling beside her, “you are the strongest women in the realms - regardless of what has happened in the past.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s my strength for when I couldn’t even use it to defend the people that I love?” Levana asked, “I couldn’t defend my children and my brother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was a different time, Eva,” Aemond said, “it’s just as you told me before when a rumor about me was spread.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana raised a brow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have the power to protect them then,” Aemond began, “but you have the power to protect others now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m amazed that you remember, Aemond,” Levana looked at him in surprise, “it’s been so long since then.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I always remember when it comes to you,” the prince said, “I just wish I tried harder sometimes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you can start trying,” Levana chuckled, “it’s never too late,” she said as she leaned closer towards him to place a kiss on his cheek. Aemond smiled at her and responded by taking her hand in his, placing a kiss on her knuckles.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can both start trying,” Levana smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded with a smile on his face. Levana chuckled slightly but just as she was about to say something, the doors burst open to reveal Besian with a very concerned look in his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Galatea and Nandor,” Besian said as he entered the room, “they’ve gone to infiltrate King’s Landing!” </span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">【𝟗𝟏】</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Levana stood in front of Harrenhal’s Painted Table as her council hung their heads low. It’s been an hour or two since Besian delivered news that Galatea and Nandor went to infiltrate King’s Landing - no one had answers that the Gold Queen was looking for and it seems as though they are running out of time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did Galatea tell you when you saw her last?” Rhaenys asked as she looked at Besian who sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She took a horse,” Besian revealed, “she said that she was going to scout the nearby areas and I asked why she wouldn’t be taking Seasmoke when it would be faster but she reasoned that it would be more inconspicuous if she went on horseback.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Ser Nandor?” Levana looked at Ser Harrold who shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ser Nandor said that he was going to make a tally of our troops,” Ser Harrold said, “he disappeared shortly after we arrived.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>An audible sigh came from the Queen as she looked at the Painted Table; her eyes glossing over the Crownlands. For a moment, Levana drowned out the noise of chatter that came from her Small Council - she needed to think of the next move. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And in her mind, she knew that her decision would be crucial.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need to create a diversion,” Levana spoke, “one that would be enough to extract Galatea and Nandor from the capital while not doing too much harm to the people of King’s Landing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many soldiers do you propose to bring?” Airell asked, “adding to that, we also need to know how many troops Aegon has.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t bring that much either,” Rhaenys said, “we’ll benefit more if we have less numbers if we just want to extract Ser Nandor and Galatea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For what reason do they have to infiltrate King’s Landing?” Laenor asked as Levana turned to her father.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Helaena and Queen Alicent.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would they…?” Besian trailed off as Levana turned to him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was supposed to be your husband, Queen Levana,” Nesrin looked up from the table, “he was supposed to be the one to infiltrate the capital.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think this is my fault?” Levana asked, “I gave a specific directive that no one was to do this and yet they’ve disobeyed my orders.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t make sense to me that they would go,” Besian leaned against his chair, “they have no attachment to Queen Alicent and Helaena or her children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if they went because it would be the </span>
<b>right </b>
<span>thing to do?” Laenor said, “isn’t that what our cause is all about?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to her father as the door opened to reveal Maester Priamos with Aemond in tow. The two males entered the chamber of the Small Council as Laenor followed the prince with his gaze. Aemond stayed by the door just beside Ser Harrold as the maester approached Levana.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grand Maester,” Levana greeted as Priamos took a deep breath as he leaned close to the Queen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve received correspondence from Galatea,” Priamos began, “they were able to infiltrate King’s Landing and are presently finding a way to remove Queen Helaena and the Dowager Queen from the capital.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did Galatea explain why?” Levana asked but the maester shook his head plainly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did they send a raven?” Besian asked, “did they carry one with them?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It seems so,” Priamos replied, “but when I checked with the maesters of Harrenhal, only one raven was missing and it was the one that arrived from King’s Landing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The only other people who know how to navigate those passages are dead,” Levana said, “the assailants who killed my children, the White Worm, and Larys Strong.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t forget Daemon,” Laenor said, “but he’s dead as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No one other than Ser Nandor and Galatea knows how to navigate through the tunnels,” Levana sighed, “the best we can do is to assign troops at our borders and around God’s Eye.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you would allow me, Your Grace,” Aemond stepped forward, “I will take Vhagar and patrol the perimeter of God’s Eye myself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys looked at Aemond with a raised brow, “a splendid idea.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Levana said plainly, “Harrenhal needs you to stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Laenor turned his attention to his daughter, “we have more than enough dragons to protect Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Besian is going back to Pyke in the morrow,” Levana reasoned, “we’ll be one dragon short.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But still four dragons strong,” Laenor responded, “we can manage without Prince Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God’s Eye is just a stone's throw away from the stronghold,” Rhaenys said, “should the prince encounter any trouble, he will be able to return to Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen took a deep breath before looking up at Aemond, “are you sure about this?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It would be an honor to serve you, My Queen,” Aemond bowed. When Levana only responded with silence, the prince lifted his head up to look at his wife who looked at him with a face of sadness and worry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be careful,” Aemond vowed, “I’ll leave your brothers alone too should I encounter them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor looked at Aemond with disdain, “I have no more intention of losing another son to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father,” Levana snapped her head to look at Laenor, “I have explained to you so many times that what happened to Lucerys was Vhagar’s doing and not Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He should have better control of his dragon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The idea that we control dragons is an illusion,” Levana said with conviction, “my Grandsire, King Viserys, would always tell me that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor kept silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if I am bonded with Cannibal, Vermithor, and Silverwing,” the Queen took a deep breath, “they can kill me if they wanted to.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you talking back to your own father now?” Laenor asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father or not,” Levana sighed, “you know what I mean.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause before Levana turned to Aemond again, “take Vhagar and head to God’s Eye but please, for the sake of our daughter, stay out of trouble.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chuckled before bowing his head again and leaving the room. Rhaenys chuckled as she turned to her son who looked at his daughter in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m shockingly impressed,” Laenor chuckled to himself, “I was not expecting you to respond to me like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, she is the Queen,” Nesrin spoke up, “and her authority has always been one that I admire since she was crowned.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need to stop looking at the past now if we are to move along with the present,” Levana said, “he will be the king, father, whether you like it or not.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“His title matters less as long as you are seated on the throne,” Laenor responded, “after you, the one who is next in power is your grandmother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unless Ana plans to give the same power to Aemond,” Rhaenys took a sip from her goblet of wine, “then I wouldn’t be so sure, my son.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I intend to make him an adviser,” Levana said. “I will have him, Galatea, and you, father.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would normally advise against it,” Laenor sighed, “but since you are the Queen, it is not in my place to go against you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled and walked beside her father. She placed a kiss on the top of her father’s head before looking at her Small Council who were chatting among themselves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only a matter of time before things changed.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Aemond made his way through the halls of Harrenhal to the yard where Vhagar stood waiting for him. He took a deep breath as he climbed the shedragon to mount her. Once he was seated on the saddle, he commanded for his dragon to take to the skies. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A thousand things were running through Aemond’s mind as soon as Vhagar was high enough in the skies. He did initially want to patrol God's Eye, but an idea came to mind that would make the infiltration of King's Landing much easier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>"Towards the Dragonpit, Vhagar," </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond commanded as the dragon bellowed before heading in the intended directi</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the very least, Aemond could provide aid to Galatea and Ser Nandor if he is inside King's Landing himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The infiltration was supposed to be his job, as many members of the Small Council implied. Thus, the prince decided to take matters into his own hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The flight to the Dragonpit was short and though Aemond wouldn’t dare to admit it - there was a sense of fear in the pit of his stomach. Since he didn’t know where Galatea and Nandor were at present, his safest bet was to proceed to the Dragonpit and make his way to the Red Keep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At a glance, it seems as though guarding the Dragonpit was the least of the Greens’ worries. Only keepers were stationed there with a minimal number of guards. Though he did know that they had alerted his family of his presence either way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince took a horse from one of the keepers and began to make his way toward the castle. He was, to put bluntly, disgusted at the state of King’s Landing. It seems that keeping the smallfolk from harm’s way was the least of their worries. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond arrived in front of the Barbican to be greeted by knights of the Kingsguard. They looked at him with disdain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am Prince Aemond of House Targaryen,” Aemond shouted, “let me in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prince Aemond is dead,” said one of the guards, “the Dowager Queen said so herself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then tell the Dowager Queen that her son is alive and well,” Aemond responded, “I bear news from Queen Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah right,” the guard laughed, “your kind ain’t welcome here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You dare talk like that to a prince?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t look like a prince to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell Queen Alicent to come and see me,” Aemond said, “then maybe I’ll spare your head.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to get it,” said the guard with a loud growl. Aemond looked at him with an amused expression as he unsheathed his sword and unmounted from the horse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come at me then,” Aemond challenged, “Ser Criston will tell you that I can easily bring you down.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“That he can.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Criston approached the Barbican with a smile on his face, </span>
<b>“it’s been too long, Your Grace.”</b>
</p><p>
<span>“Not long enough,” Aemond responded as the gates slowly started to open, “had you come earlier, I wouldn’t have had to unsheathe my sword.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Hand approached him with a chuckle, “apologies, I was tending to the king.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon is still alive?” Aemond asked, “that’s news to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is your business here, Prince Aemond?” Criston asked, “surely you aren’t here for a simple visit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here to see my mother and sister,” Aemond stated, “I also bear a message from Queen Levana.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good to know that your wife is still alive,” Criston chuckled, “I assume that  she’s already given birth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond glared, “that’s none of your business.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Helaena ran out of the castle and wrapped her arms around the prince, embracing him tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re alive,” Helaena said, “is sister with you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond shook his head, “I’m here to see you and mother to deliver a message from her in private.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What you have to say to them,” Criston interjected, “you can say to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You might be The Hand but that doesn’t put you above me,” Aemond responded, “I will deliver the message to them in private.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Helaena didn’t wait for Criston to get another word out when she pulled Aemond into the palace. Immediately, the Queen began to talk about what had happened in the few months that he left the Red Keep; in his mind, Aemond always thought of Helaena to be too innocent for what was currently happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t supposed to be this way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are your children?” Aemond asked as Helaena stopped in her tracks. She looked around her to see if anyone was in proximity before leaning closer to her brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Galatea took them,” Helaena whispered, “she’ll come back for us tonight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a wave of relief that washed over Aemond - at least he knew that Galatea and Nandor were safe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re certain that they’re alright?” Aemond asked, “and that they will be back?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Helaena nodded, “they found a way to the Tower of the Hand,” she whispered, “that’s where they’re going to retrieve mother and I.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does Aegon know?” Aemond asked, pulling his sister to the side. Helaena shook her head, “it’s only mother and I.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond sighed deeply as he looked around as well, “take me to the tower.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Helaena smiled, “I knew that sister Levana wouldn’t leave us,” she said as she began to walk toward the Tower of the Hand. There was definitely something eerie about what has become of the Red Keep. What was once a vibrant castle brimming with laughter was not desolate and bleak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Grandsire?” Aemond asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s been sent to the prison,” Helaena revealed, “Aegon doesn’t know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is he?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon is confined to his room,” Helaena sighed, “his condition has become worse and the maesters fear that he won’t have much time left.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they arrived at the Dowager Queen’s room, Helaena went inside first. She greeted their mother before Aemond walked inside. The condition that Alicent was in was, in a word, poor. She no longer had the glow that she had and she looked sickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond?” Alicent stood from the bed, “is that really you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond approached his mother and nodded. The Dowager Queen quickly embraced her son and began to cry in his chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you had died,” Alicent sobbed, “are you alone? Where’s Eva?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva is safe,” Aemond said, “and you should be as well when Galatea and Nandor come to retrieve you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You knew about that?” Alicent asked, “did Eva send for them?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded simply, “I was supposed to be the one but Eva refused to let me go.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you get there, Aemond?” Alicent asked, “did you use the tunnels as well?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince shook his head, “I came on Vhagar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>"They let you?" Alicent looked at him in shock, "I'm surprised that Ser Criston didn't strike you down." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"If he did," Aemond chuckled, "he'd have the wrath of the Mother of Dragons." </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a loud noise coming from the walls when a passageway opened to reveal Galatea who looked at Aemond in complete shock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"My Prince," Galatea greeted, "you've come."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"This was supposed to be my task," Aemond responded, "moreover, you disobeyed your Queen's orders." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"It needed to be done," Galatea said before turning to look at the two females, "we should be going." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent took a deep breath before walking towards Galatea. Helaena followed suit and so did Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have to retrieve Vhagar," Aemond said as Galatea nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We'll be passing by an exit that will give you access to Flea Bottom," Galatea stated, "you can take that passage to get to the Dragonpit." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Aemond," Alicent placed a hand on her son's shoulder, "we should stay together." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond shook his head, "I have to retrieve my dragon and you would be safer if you stayed with Galatea." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent hesitated, "will you be safe?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I arrived safely, didn't I?" Aemond responded, "I can return to Harrenhal unscathed." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea stopped by an exit and pointed at the passage, "that will lead you to the Dragonpit." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded and began to make his way down the passage. His mother watched as the prince disappeared down the darkness of the path. An audible sigh escaped from Alicent’s lips as Galatea began to walk again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to extend my thanks to you,” Alicent spoke, “this was very risky.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t do this for you,” Galatea said, “I did it for Queen Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is she really the Queen now?” Helaena asked, “the Gold Queen?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea nodded proudly, “the Gold Queen.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Aemond was able to navigate through the tunnels and emerged in the streets of King’s Landing. The Dragonpit was in his line of sight which urged the prince to pick up the pace. He almost ran to the stronghold when a loud roar erupted from the skies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes widened when he saw a yellow dragon circle around the Red Keep from a distance. Soon, he heard loud cries coming from different directions when flames started to engulf the streets of King's Landing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond knew that he needed to retrieve his dragon quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With all his strength, the prince ran towards the Dragonpit. He would push and shove anyone who ran towards his direction until he finally reached the stronghold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vhagar was restless by the time that Aemond arrived. The prince placed a hand on his dragon before hurriedly mounting her. He could hear the cries of his sister's dragon from the depths of the Dragonpit but decided against pursuing Dreamfyre. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He needed to return to Harrenhal to warn his wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Vhagar took to the skies, Aemond watched as soldiers in black poured into the city. Syrax took its place on one of the Red Keep's towers, breathing fire into the streets as the smallfolk tried to flee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon, Aemond saw banners of Houses Stark, Arryn, and Velaryon being carried into the capital as more soldiers poured in. With a heavy heart, the prince flew away from the Capital and towards the direction of Harrenhal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only a matter of time before the capital would be overrun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This is what they all feared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Blacks have taken King's Landing.</span>

<span>“Your Grace!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Harrold rushed into the Great Hall as Levana looked up at him from her seat at the end of the Painted Table. The entirety of the Small Council as well as the Lords and Ladies present looked at the Lord Commander of the Queensguard in worry as he walked towards Levana. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pyke is under siege, Your Grace,” Ser Harrold revealed, “it’s the Velaryon Fleet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys looked at her granddaughter who stood up from her seat and began to make her way towards the door. Ser Harrold followed after her as she began to untie the skirt of her dress; her clothes are tailored in a manner that her skirt could easily come off whenever she needed to ride Vermithor. She had riding gear under her dress to ensure that she’d be able to take flight whenever she needed to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Besian and Grey Ghost are in Pyke, yes?” Levana asked as she began to put on her riding gloves. Ser Harrold followed after her and so did Princess Rhaenys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Urge your grandsire to leave the Blacks,” Rhaenys said, “he will listen to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly,” Levana sighed, “I don’t understand why he’s still with the Blacks in the first place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>"He has his reasons, Ana," Rhaenys sighed, "no matter how unbelievable they are."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen sighed as the guards opened the doors to the courtyard for her. Vermithor, Silverwing, and Cannibal immediately stood in attention as Levana approached them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When Aemond returns,” Levana took a deep breath as she mounted Vermithor, “he shall remain in Harrenhal to make sure that any advances by the Blacks are dealt with.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Understood, My Queen,” Ser Harrold bowed his head as Vermithor and Levana’s other two dragons took to the skies. Rhaenys walked to the courtyard and watched as Levana and her dragons disappeared into the clouds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen Who Never Was placed a hand on her heart as Laenor followed after her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I sometimes wonder what's in her head," Laenor sighed, "she is the Queen and if something happens to her, the cause will fall apart." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Laenor," Rhaenys sighed, "your daughter, with what very little she has in terms of allies, is trying to hold the realm together." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor took a deep breath as Rhaenys turned to him, "Levana stays true to doing what is right because she has never started a battle." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know she means well but what is this call all for if something happens to her?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Then we will carry on with her wishes," Rhaenys said, "crown or not, she is doing this for the realm and that is why she cares not for what might happen to her." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys smiled, "she is the Queen that the realm needs." </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Levana's flight to Pyke was quick — or at least, to her it was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A thousand things were running in her head as her dragons began to attack the Velaryon Fleet. The Queen looked at the damage that the battle has done; most of them missed the castle itself but members of the Black Queen's army already found their way to the shore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Grace!" Besian yelled as Vermithor dodged an arrow that was aimed at the princess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Where are the children?!" Levana asked as Silverwing and Cannibal began to rain fire on the fleet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Safe," Besian said, "they are hidden within the castle." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana let out a sigh of relief as she looked towards the fleet of ships that the Iron Fleet and the Triarchy were presently battling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Have you spotted Lord Corlys?" Levana asked as Besian nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"He is commanding from one of the ships in the far end of the fleet," Besian said, "they also have two dragons who have tried to attack me but I avoided it." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"What did they look like?" Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"One is a mud brown," Besian reported, "and the other is green." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Vermax…" Levana trailed off as she placed a hand on Vermithor's neck. The Bronze Fury immediately rushed towards the fleet, burning through the ships that they passed by. Just before they could reach the end of the Velaryon Fleet, they were intercepted by the brown dragon that Besian told her of. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Who are you?" Levana asked as the rider looked at her with an amused expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"So you're the Gold Queen," the female rider spoke, "I'm impressed that you were able to clear out the Dragonmont but lucky for me, you didn't find Sheepstealer." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I asked you who you were," Levana said, "I will not ask thrice." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"They call me Nettles," the female said, "and the Black Queen sends her regards to her only daughter." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"She has no children here," Levana hissed, "why have you come?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"King's Landing has fallen and Pyke is next." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana's eyes widened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, the Queen was frozen. King's Landing has fallen into the hands of the Black Queen which means that Galatea, Nandor, Helaena, and the Dowager Queen could be in trouble. Thoughts came flooding into her head that her trance was broken when Sheepstealer began to attack Vermithor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Bronze Fury fought as his rider tried to gain her composure. Sheepstealer was relentless in its attacks, relying on speed to distract Vermithor but the latter fought on; breathing fire toward the former and its rider. </span>
</p><p>
<span>*Cannibal!" Levana shouted as the black dragon came down from the sky, locking Sheepstealer in its claws as the brown dragon tried to flee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silverwing also came to join the battle, effectively knocking Sheepstealer into the sea.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Retrieve the dragon,</span>
</em>
<span>" Levana ordered, </span>
<em>
<span>"make sure it's alive." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Silverwing and Cannibal dove into the waters to do as they are told when Vermax came flying towards Vermithor. Besian and Grey Ghost arrived shortly after, motioning to attack the smaller dragon but Levana stopped him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jacaerys," Levana called, "where is Grandsire?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"He isn't here for a discussion, Ana," Jacaerys responded as he looked at his older sister, "he wants to overrun Pyke." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"With what?" Levana asked, "my fleet is triple the size of his own." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"That's why mother sent me and Nettles," Jacaerys said, "we thought that all your dragons would be in Harrenhal but Grey Ghost alone overwhelmed us." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will only ask once, Jacaerys," Levana sighed, "join me."</span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince looked at his sister with a sad expression, "Joffrey and I are all mother has left." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"If she surrenders, I will extend sanctuary to her." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Grace, you can't be serio—" Besian was cut-off by Levana's glare. The Queen looked at her younger brother and then one of the ships where Lord Corlys stood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I do not wish to continue fighting you or Grandsire," Levana said, "I do not wish for you to get hurt, Jace." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I can't just leave mother, Ana," Jacaerys said, "she's already gone crazy." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why so?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"She lost Viserys and Aegon," the prince said, "we are what's left of her children." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I am not her daughter," Levana said, "I have denounced her." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Jacaerys was about to speak, a spear flew towards Levana. Though Vermithor was able to move away from its path, he wasn't quick enough that the spear managed to cut through the Queen's shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana hissed in pain as she looked down at the direction where the spear came from. Lord Corlys stood valiantly on the deck of one of the ships with another spear in hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I wish to speak to him," Levana said, "this has to stop, Jace." </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>"Grandsire!" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor flew just above the ship where Corlys Velaryon stood with a spear in hand. Levana unsheathed the Conqueror's Sword as she looked at her Grandsire with a sad yet determined expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why are you doing this?" Levana asked, "it shouldn't have come to this." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corlys stared at her, "where is your grandmother?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"She's in Harrenhal with my father," Levana said, "lower your spear and let us talk properly, Grandsire." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corlys glared but relented. He lowered the spear while Levana sheathed her sword. The Queen ordered for her dragon to fly lower so she could unmount him and board the ship. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why are you still with Queen Rhaenyra?" Levana asked, "I had thought that you would accept my proposal of sanctuary, Grandsire."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I have to protect the Velaryon name, Ana," Corlys responded, "I cannot see it end on the account of this war." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Why side with the Black Queen?" Levana asked again, "you knew that my fleet and dragons could easily overwhelm you but you still came." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ana, this is how we can keep our House safe." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana glared, "Grandsire, you've already lost a grandson because of this war and you nearly lost your own wife and son." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corlys kept silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"So long as you side with Queen Rhaenyra, our House will fall," Levana said, "is that what you want, Grandsire?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>"What am I to do, Levana?" Corlys asked, "I swore an oath." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"So did my mother when she married my father, but look at where it has brought us," Levana said, "it doesn't have to be like this." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corlys took a deep breath as Silverwing and Cannibal emerged from the sea with Sheepstealer. The three dragons made their way back to the shore as Levana walked towards her Grandsire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will not force you if this is not what you want," Levana said, "but I am giving you a choice, Grandsire."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"A choice?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Just as I gave it to my grandmother," Levana said, "I will not force you to switch sides, but know that there are more ways to honor the Velaryon name than to stand with Queen Rhaenyra." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned her back and mounted Vermithor, "Pyke and Harrenhal will be open for you and my brothers, Grandsire." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are they really alive?” Corlys asked as Levana took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have never lied to you, Grandsire,” Levana said, “I have never lied to anyone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corlys stared at Levana as Vermithor ascended to the sky. The Bronze Fury laid fire on what remained of the Velaryon Fleet before disappearing into the Pyke stronghold. The Lord of the Tides ordered for his fleet to retreat. Jacaerys, on the other hand, watched as his sister retreated into the castle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Velaryon prince looked at the ocean for a short while, hoping that Nettles would rise from the ocean, but as luck (or misfortune) would have it, she was best left in the depths. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"You can stay," Corlys said, "if you want to be with your sister, you can stay here." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Mother won't take it kindly," Jacaerys responded, “she’ll further blame my sister for it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will take the blame,” Corlys said, “I am her Hand and if anything, I can say that you chose to die a valiant death by attacking the fleet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t leave Joffrey,” Jacaerys stated, earning a sigh from his Grandsire. Lord Corlys looked at his eldest grandson with a sad expression before shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “We best get back to King’s Landing,” Corlys sighed, “your mother will be worried.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys gazed upon Pyke one last time before ordering his dragon to flee. He would have to reunite with his older sister at a different time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are my children?!” Levana demanded as she unmounted from her dragon. The maesters greeted her and explained that the children had been sent to her quarters in the Sea Tower to defend them from the attack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Almost too quickly, Levana rushed to her chambers where the nurses sat with the children. Aegon and Viserys were visibly afraid and Rhaenys wouldn’t stop crying in the nurse's arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as they saw Levana, the two young princes immediately rushed to her and wrapped their arms around each of her legs. The Queen took a deep breath as she knelt down to meet their height.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon and Viserys had tear stains down their cheeks - a sight that tugged at Levana’s heart. She wiped their tears away and wrapped her arms around them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here now,” Levana said, “I won’t let them get you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two boys wrapped their arms around her as the nurse approached Levana. The Queen stood up and took Rhaenys in her arms, trying her best to calm the babe down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother is here now,” Levana repeated, “you’re safe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The babe in the Queen’s arms began to settle as she took a seat on her bed. The nurse left the room to collect meals for the children, while Levana assured the children that no harm would come to them. Aegon found comfort in leaning his head against Levana’s shoulder while Viserys stayed on the floor by her leg, hugging it tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Children,” Levana said, “I will have to leave you again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please don’t!” Viserys stood up abruptly, “what if they come back and take us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Besian will be here,” Levana explained, “he will protect the three of you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon began to sob again, “please stay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at the three children and sighed. She leaned her back against the pillows of her bed while Aegon and Viserys made themselves comfortable beside her. The Queen whispered words to soothe the boys and the babe in her arms before looking out the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only a matter of time before Levana had to bring the battle to Queen Rhaenyra. But for now, she was going to make sure that the children were safe and calm. She wasn’t about to leave them after such an encounter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t about to be like the mother that abandoned her. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Aemond stood by the balcony of Levana’s chambers in Harrenhal as he watched the soldiers march on the grounds. As much as he wanted to follow his wife in Pyke, she left orders that he would have to stay in case the Blacks launched an attack on Harrenhal while she was gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince would have to resign himself to waiting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana wasn’t back yet and so were Galatea, Nandor, and his family. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His train of thought was interrupted when the doors opened to reveal his father-by-law, Laenor, with an unreadable expression on his face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lord Laenor,” Aemond greeted, “has the Queen returned?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Laenor responded as he walked into the room, closing the doors behind him as he approached the younger male, “you saw the Blacks overrun King’s Landing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet you did nothing?” Laenor asked, “you could have burnt the city to the ground!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not what Levana would have wanted,” Aemond said, “and I only take orders from my Queen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am one of her advisors.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are not the Hand,” Aemond responded, “the only other person who has authority over me is Princess Rhaenys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor looked at him with disdain, “Levana is my daughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s had many fathers in this life,” Aemond said, “every one of them has left her at some point and I honestly don’t see you as any different.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause between them as Laenor glared at the Targaryen prince. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I do not mean to compare,”</b>
<span> Aemond continued, </span>
<b>“but the only father that my wife ever had was King Viserys.”</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Do you understand the consequences of what you’re saying?” </span>
</em>
<span>Laenor asked, but Aemond just looked at him plainly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do not intend to be manipulated by fear, Lord Laenor,” Aemond said, “my wife and I have been through many things and we have both learned that manipulation will only lead to our own demise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond looked at Laenor one last time before walking towards the door, “I am, indeed, indebted to you and the Black Queen for allowing me to marry your daughter, but if you are going to assume authority because you are Levana’s father then you are not fit to be in her council.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor watched as Aemond exited the room. He stood inside his daughter’s chambers with an amused smile on his face. For years, he always doubted whether Aemond was suited to marry his daughter - it wasn’t just because his daughter would be Queen one day - but it was also because Laenor questioned his own suitability to stand beside a Queen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He always harbored a certain dislike for Aemond because of how comfortable he was with Levana. Laenor owed it to the fact that his daughter would be his only </span>
<em>
<span>legitimate </span>
</em>
<span>child and the only daughter that he would have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond’s response to him more than proved that he was suited to be with Levana.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor now believed that Aemond was suited to be his daughter’s king. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was nearly dawn when Levana reached Harrenhal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stayed with the children until they agreed to let her go on the promise that they would see her again soon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen was exhausted, to say the least. As soon as she unmounted from Vermithor, she felt the weight of her own body as she tried her best to walk into the castle. As soon as the doors opened, Levana almost fell forward, but to her shock, someone caught her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana expected to see her father or even Ser Harrold, but what she didn’t expect to see was Alicent. The older female smiled at Levana, “you haven’t been taking care of yourself, have you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The latter smiled as Alicent wrapped her arms around Levana, pulling her into an embrace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Eva,” Alicent whispered as Levana nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Helaena and the children?” Levana asked as Alicent helped her stand. The Gold Queen looked toward the direction of the hallway where she saw Aemond walking towards them with the maester in tow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re resting,” Alicent said, “you should be resting as well, Eva.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head, “there is no rest during a war like this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maester Priamos wants to take a look at you,” Aemond said as he walked towards his wife, “he’s concerned that your body might not be able to handle the stresses of the war.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Levana assured, “I just haven’t been able to sleep properly.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which is why I would advise against flying,” Maester Priamos said, “for now at least.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana’s eyes widened, “I command the skies, Maester,” she reminded, “there is no rest for me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your body can no longer handle your exhaustion, Your Grace,” Maester Priamos said, “I have been observing you since the birth of Princess Rhaenys and you have not had a moment to rest since then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Blacks have taken over King’s Landing,” Levana reminded, “and we have not produced a plan of attack as of late.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“All things can be handled on the morrow,” Alicent said, “tonight, you have to rest before your body truly collapses.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana took a deep breath as she began to walk past them. Aemond rolled his eyes as he caught up to her, offering his arm to the Queen, who begrudgingly held on him tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are the children?” Aemond asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Terrified,” Levana sighed, “all of them are and I cannot blame them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are at the height of the war, Eva,” Aemond said, “we cannot risk you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen simply chuckled, “I am not as fragile as you think I am.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a question of your fragility, Eva,” Aemond turned to her, “we are worried about your health.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana simply shook her head as she continued to walk towards her chambers. She cursed at herself as she placed a hand on the wall to steady herself. Her vision was getting blurry as she continued down the hall. Aemond stood beside her, holding her up as Levana stilled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond,” Levana called as the prince nodded. Aemond swiftly took Levana in his arms and continued down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re stubborn,” Aemond chuckled, “you do acknowledge that, correct?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen smiled weakly at him, “not as stubborn as you when we were much younger, I assure you.” </span>

<em>
<span>Levana found herself in the Great Hall of the Red Keep. Though, she could hardly say that it was just how she remembered it. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The room was barren and the window behind it was reduced to nothing. The entire hall was in a complete disarray and if she didn’t know better, she would think that she was in an entirely different place.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The shadow of the Iron Throne loomed over her as she stared blankly at it. She could hardly believe that it was still standing tall. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“It isn't so marvelous now, is it, little moon?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana turned to see King Viserys standing behind her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"The Iron Throne once looked to be so powerful but when its kingdom is reduced to rubble, it's just another chair."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The female could only stare at the sight of her grandfather - he was much younger, much healthier than he was when she saw him last. This was an image of her grandfather that she remembered from when she was just a toddler. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Grandsire?” Levana began to walk towards him, “is that you?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Who else would call you their little moon?” King Viserys chuckled, “as far as I am concerned, I am the only one who calls you by such an endearment.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana could only smile as King Viserys walked closer to her. The king smiled nostalgically as the Gold Queen looked at him. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The world wasn't kind to you after I died, was it?” King Viserys asked as Levana could only nod. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Little moon, I apologize for putting such a heavy burden on your shoulders,” King Viserys said as he took Levana’s hands in his, “but trust me when I say that you are the only person capable of keeping the realm together.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I know, Grandsire,” Levana responded, “and I do not blame you for what has happened to me.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>There was a short pause before Levana wrapped her arms around her grandfather. Tears were pouring down her face as the king comforted her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This was Levana at her most vulnerable. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Grandsire?" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The Gold Queen's eyes widened. The voice sounded so familiar to her that she couldn't help but cry more. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The king looked towards the door with a smile, "children, come, we have a guest."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Levana," King Viserys broke the embrace as two children ran towards them. In an instant, two pairs of arms wrapped themselves around Levana's hips. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"They've missed their mother." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana looked down to meet the eyes of her fallen children, Aemma and Baelon. The two looked at her with so much happiness and excitement that Levana almost believed that this was real. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Mother, why are you crying?" Aemma asked as Levana knelt down to meet their height. Joy and sorrow filled her heart as she embraced her children tightly. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"I've missed you both so much," Levana whispered, holding the children tighter. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Grandsire has been taking care of us, mother!" Baelon said, "Uncle Lucerys and Grandma Aemma too!" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Lucerys?" Levana repeated, "Lucerys is here?" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana turned to King Viserys who gave her a small smile as someone rushed into the hall. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"You two always give me a hard time," Said another familiar voice, "I wonder how your mother caught up—" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Luke?" Levana asked as she stood up. Lucerys looked at her with a shocked expression as the former began to walk towards him. When they were just inches from each other, Levana immediately wrapped her arms around her younger brother and pulled him into an embrace. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"I'm sorry," Levana whispered, "I'm so sorry, Lucerys," she sobbed as Lucerys embraced her tightly. </span>

</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Am I not invited to this reunion?" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana looked over Lucerys' shoulder to see a beautiful woman with long blonde hair. She bore a striking resemblance to Queen Rhaenyra that Levana could only stare as the woman walked towards her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>"Our little moon,"</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> the woman spoke as Lucerys broke the embrace with her sister, allowing the older woman to walk closer to Levana, </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>"you make me so proud."</em>
</b>
<em>
<span>  </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"This is your grandmother, Levana," King Viserys said, "Queen Aemma." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Gods…" Levana was speechless as Queen Aemma wrapped her arms around the former. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This was a dream that Levana wished wouldn’t end.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You don’t have much time here,” Aemma said longingly, “but we just wanted to somehow lessen the burden on your shoulders.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We want you to know that we are watching over you, little moon,” Viserys said, “and we are with you.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Go back, Ana,” Lucerys smiled, “the realm needs their Queen.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana was in disbelief. She tried her best to speak but nothing came out of her mouth; everything went silent as her vision went dark.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Levana woke up in a cold sweat. The moment that she woke up, tears began to fall from her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond, from his chair by the door, walked over to Levana and sat by her. There was a concerned expression on his face as his wife turned to him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw them,” Levana said, “they were in my dream.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baelon and Aemma?” Aemond asked, “what did they say?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not just them,” Levana took a deep breath as Aemond took the cup from above her drawer and handed it to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was my father there?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “Lucerys and Queen Aemma as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did they tell you?” Aemond asked, “what else did you see?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen took a sip from the cup and sighed, “I saw the Iron Throne, but ruin surrounded it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think it’s a premonition?” Aemond asked as his wife nodded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I usually don’t think of my dreams as such, but it’s already happened once,” Levana said, “I can’t ignore my dreams after that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a slight pause between the two of them as Aemond held Levana’s hand in his. The female leaned her head on his shoulder as she stared into the skies outside her room. It was a comfortable silence that was much appreciated by Levana during this time of great noise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond,” Levana began, “I once asked you if you would die for me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I will,” Aemond said, “I will die a thousand deaths for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow, we begin the planning to take King’s Landing,” Levana said, “because of this, I have a new question to ask of you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it, my love?” Aemond asked, “tell me and I shall see it done.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked up at Aemond and gazed upon his eye and the sapphire that adorned his other, </span>
<b>“will you live for me?”</b>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond paused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you live for me, Aemond?” Levana asked again, “for me and our Rhaenys?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince smiled and placed a kiss on the top of Levana’s head, “I will live for you, My Queen,” Aemond said, “I will live for you and </span>
<b>all of the children.</b>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled and so did Aemond. Slowly, the Queen inched towards the prince; the latter meeting her halfway as their lips pressed against each other in a passionate kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen melted into Aemond’s arms as the kiss became more heated. It was such a long time since they had such a fire between them that it reminded Aemond of the first time that they ever kissed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once the kiss was broken, Aemond embraced Levana tightly and whispered, </span>
<em>
<span>“I will live for you, my Queen, and the love of my life and the next.” </span>
</em>

<p>
<span>Dawn came upon Harrenhal as Levana, clad in her royal robes, walked towards the Great Hall where her Small Council waited. Today was a crucial day for the Golds as this would determine how they might win or lose the war against the Blacks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Harrold walked beside Levana, observing the Queen as they arrived in front of the doors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They will expect you to say something,” Ser Harrold said, “you might need to think of a few words, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been fussing about that the entire morning,” Levana chuckled, “what words can I say to people who have sworn their lives to me and I cannot guarantee that they’ll survive?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace, whoever stands with you knows what they are getting into,” Ser Harrold reasoned, “we are laying down our lives for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish you didn’t have to word it that way,” Levana sighed, “I don’t want people to lay down their lives for me, but I do want them to fight for themselves.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Harrold smiled as Levana took a deep breath. The Queen turned towards the Lord Commander of her Queensguard and smiled at him, “thank you, Ser Harrold, for being by my side throughout this ordeal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swore that I would protect you when you were just a babe,” Ser Harrold responded, “and I will do so until the day that I take my last breath.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled, "I hope that won't be soon." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ser Harrold chuckled as he pushed the doors of the Great Hall open. The room was filled with Levana's Small Council, as well as the other Lords and Ladies of Levana's Sworn Houses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Queen Levana of House Targaryen, First of Her Name, Queen of the Rhoynar, the Andals, and the First Men, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, the Protector of the Realm, and the Mother of Dragons!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana walked inside the Great Hall, taking her place at the far end of the Painted Table. She observed the markers before looking at her father, who nodded a response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our fleet has begun its journey to King’s Landing,” Laenor began, “they are led by Airell and Besian.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They need to pass by Casterly Rock,” Levana said, “will they be alright?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Besian intends to lay waste upon Casterly Rock and the Lannisters before they proceed to King’s Landing,” Rhaenys said, “they will also be paying House Tyrell a visit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do hope that they meet with House Tyrell in good nature,” Levana sighed, “as House Tyrell is a neutral party, we cannot force their support.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Airell and Besian are aware,” Rhaenys said, “the only places that they intend to lay waste upon are Casterly Rock and Storm’s End.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Baratheons are our kin,” Levana mentioned, “I would rather that they be given fair treatment as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What of my maternal grandmother’s family?” Levana asked, “what of The Eyrie?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just like House Stark, they also refuse to turn the cloak on Queen Rhaenyra.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And King’s Landing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They hung Otto Hightower today,” Maester Priamos announced, “King Aegon is nowhere to be found.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s as good as dead,” Aemond said from his place in the corner of the room, “I doubt that he would get anywhere far enough.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is still Helaena’s husband and the father of her children,” Levana said, “the concern I have for Aegon stems from my desire to keep their family together.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have spies in Dragonstone, Your Grace,” Priamos reminded, “perhaps I can write to them to inquire about King Aegon’s whereabouts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please do, Grand Maester,” Levana nodded, “while you’re at it, please inquire about my brothers as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is another concern that we need to address,” Rhaenys took a deep breath, “Queen Rhaenyra has imprisoned your grandsire, Lord Corlys.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra stood in front of the Iron Throne. By now, it had been days since her forces took over King's Landing and she had been restless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Iron Throne loomed over her as if it was threatening her to just try and take her place on it. Queen Rhaenyra, for the lack of a better term, was afraid of taking a seat on the Iron Throne for fear that it might reject her as a ruler.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra turned to see Jacaerys approaching him with a concerned expression. The Queen smiled slightly as she walked towards her son, embracing him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any news of Pyke or Harrenhal?” Rhaenyra asked as the prince shook his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think Ana has any intention of attacking so soon,” Jacaerys said, “that wouldn’t be like her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra sighed, "when I was much younger and Levana was no more than a babe, I would stand here and marvel at the Iron Throne with her." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys kept silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"I dreamt of the day that I would pass down my crown to her," Rhaenyra continued, "she was the best of me and your father." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do believe that Ana is the best of all of us,” Jacaerys said, “she had the kindest heart even to those who didn’t deserve her kindness.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That kindness was her downfall,” Rhaenyra gritted her teeth, “why did I agree to leaving her in Driftmark in the first place?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother?” Jacaerys raised a brow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If Daemon agreed to take her with us to Dragonstone,” Rhaenyra sighed, “we would never have this problem in the first place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why was my sister left in Dragonstone?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra turned to look at the Iron Throne again, “it was to keep the loyalty of House Velaryon to me until the day that I took the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana said that our father was alive,” Jacaerys asked again, “is it true?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jacaerys, what is the matter with you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I deserve to know the truth, </span>
<b>mother,</b>
<span>” the Velaryon prince said firmly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is no truth to tell,” Rhaenyra responded, “your sister betrayed me and that’s that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince looked at his mother with a glare, </span>
<b>“did she betray you or did you betray her?” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“Be careful of what you accuse of me, Jacaerys,” Rhaenyra turned to her son, “I am the Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I am your son!” Jacaerys responded, “I stood by you when everyone else wanted to leave!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra took a step back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I, at least, deserve to know the truth!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra looked at her son with furrowed brows, “the truth is it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Black Queen took a deep breath, “then it is what you’ll get.” </span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">【𝟗𝟖】</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>“You had every chance to make things right with Ana,” Jacaerys hissed, “and yet you resigned to listening to Daemon?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is my husband,” Rhaenyra reasoned, “we responded to the situation as we saw fit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana is your daughter!” Jacaerys spat back, “she was loyal to you, mother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jace…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Despite all that has happened, Levana was loyal to you!” Jacaerys shouted, “when Lucerys’ claim was being questioned, Ana defended him and us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was her duty--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was your duty, mother!” Jacaerys responded, “Ana did not have to stand there and be scrutinized by Ser Vaemond and the Greens because of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have no right to speak to me like this, Prince Jacaerys,” Rhaenyra glared, “you forget yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“Mother,” </b>
<span>Jacaerys took a deep breath,</span>
<b> “in the pursuit of the Iron Throne, it is you who have forgotten yourself.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“I can have you jailed for that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am the only one left who is loyal to you, mother,” Jacaerys stated, “Joffrey is too young to be at war, Lord Corlys is in prison, and Lord Cregan has begun his retreat.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra looked at her son with a stunned expression as Jacaerys bowed his head slightly and turned to face the door. He began to walk towards it, his hands balled into fists and tears streaming down his face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything that had happened to them - to Levana - was orchestrated by their own mother and Daemon. His heart was filled with betrayal and sorrow as he made his way to his chambers that once belonged to Levana. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Jacaerys was in the safety of his chambers, he took a seat on the bed; looking around the room to at least catch a semblance of reality. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He had just confronted his mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t know what her mother’s plan for him was but he was sure that he was slowly falling out of grace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a deep breath before standing up and walking towards the shelf filled with books of Targaryen history. Jacaerys pulled one out that seemed most familiar to him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was his sister’s favorite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are we to do now, Ana?” Jacaerys asked as he scanned the pages of the book, “our mother has gone mad.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>.”The fleet will be able to surround the borders of the Narrow Sea and Blackwater Bay in two days' time,” Priamos reported, “we shall have our army begin its march at dawn.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “and our dragon riders?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will ride with you sister,” Baela smiled, “it would be my honor to ride for the Queen who will save this realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded and wrapped an arm around Baela’s shoulder, pulling her close as she turned to Rhaena. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would offer you Sheepstealer, Rhaena,” Levana began, “but I will not allow you to fly into this war unprepared.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaena nodded, “I will ensure that everything here will be in shape.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen nodded as she turned to her father and Ser Qarl, “I know that both of you have laid down your swords years ago but--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will fight for you, Ana,” Laenor smiled, “nothing would give me greater pride than to fight for my daughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As will I,” Ser Qarl nodded as the Queen smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rhaena and I will operate from Harrenhal,” Rhaenys said as Levana nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Galatea will also remain in Harrenhal,” Levana turned to the lady who smiled in agreement, “we need at least one dragon here and Seasmoke is bigger than Vermax and Tyraxes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about Syrax?” Laenor asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt the Black Queen will allow Syrax to leave King’s Landing,” Aemond said, “she needs her mount with her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you, Prince Aemond?” Laenor asked, “where will you be?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My place is by my Queen,” Aemond said as he turned to Levana, “I will fly with her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at her husband with a smile of approval as the Prince bowed his head to her. The Gold Queen looked at the Painted Table with a mournful expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"After this war, we must extend hand to all the lands and Houses," Levana began, "regardless of who they swore to, it will be our first priority to help them." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"It shall be done, Your Grace," Rhaenys nodded, her eyes glossing over to Aemond. The Queen Who Never Was pursed her lips as she took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Forgive me, Your Grace," Rhaenys said, "but there is something that concerns me." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Yes, Grandmother?" Levana asked, "speak freely." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Prince Aemond," Rhaenys began, "if you are to fly with your wife, I would see it fit that you be crowned as King before the war." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I agree with Princess Rhaenys," Maester Priamos said, "it will further be a show of strength." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to her husband, "your thoughts, Prince Aemond?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Title or not," Aemond said, "I will serve my wife, the rightful Queen." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We shall crown Aemond as King before we strike King's Landing," Rhaenys said, "with the Queen's permission, of course." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"If Prince Aemond deems this the right time to take his place as my King Consort," Levana sighed, "so be it." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I hope, for the sake of the realm," Laenor began, "he would deny."</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Father, what do you have against my husband?" Levana asked, "he has been loyal to me, an astounding father, and a loving husband." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"He killed your brother, Ana."</span>
</p><p>
<b>"Vhagar killed my brother,"</b>
<span> Levana said, </span>
<b>"I was there and you were not; whatever you accuse him of is invalid in this Court."</b>
</p><p>
<span>"Be reasonable, Levana!" Laenor argued but the Gold Queen would not have it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"You have no right to ask me to be reasonable, father," Levana said, "you left me to fend for myself while you escaped to Essos and while I do love you, I will not stand here and allow you to talk about my husband like this." </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Great Hall went silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Aemond had his faults," Levana continued, "he is paying for them as we speak and regardless of whatever has happened, the title of King Consort is his to claim." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor hung his head low. His daughter was right and he knew that he overstepped his own boundaries by talking about Aemond in that manner — he forgot that as long as Levana was to be Queen, the one-eyed prince would be her king. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Prince Aemond," Rhaenys cleared her throat, "what say you?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond turned to Levana who smiled at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Prince Aemond will be crowned at dawn," Levana announced, "before the lot of our troops begin their march to King's Landing."</span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Dawn rose upon Harrenhal when Queen Levana took her place on the seat of the stronghold as a procession began from the door. The female glanced around the room, imagining how it would have looked like when King Jaehaerys was seated in the same seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Great Hall was filled with soldiers from the Golden Assembly, the Lords and Ladies who swore to Levana, and, of course, the Queen’s Small Council. At the forefront of the entourage was Rhaena, who held the King’s Crown on top of a cushion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Much like Levana’s crown, Aemond’s was a golden circlet that was adorned with rubies. According to Lord Laenor, their crowns were crafted from a mixture of Valyrian steel and the finest gold that the Free Cities could produce. The rubies that adorned their crowns were also among the best that Pentos could carry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind Rhaena was Baela, who carried Dark Sister in her hands. The Queen’s Hand, Princess Rhaenys, and her Grand Maester, Priamos, followed after the Velaryon princesses. The Queensguard, led by Sers Harrold and Nandor, came after them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Prince Aemond came into view. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince was clad in the colors of their house - Red and Black - as requested by the Queen, who sat straight as Aemond knelt in front of the throne. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Queen Levana, today, we present to you, Prince Aemond,” Maester Priamos began, “with your grace, he shall be crowned your King Consort.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaena approached the Maester with the crown as Rhaenys walked to Levana’s side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prince Aemond,” The Queen’s Hand began, “from this day, you will be called to the Queen’s side as her King, adviser, and her sworn ally.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear to my Queen,” Aemond looked up at Levana, “the true Queen of the Realms.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you swear to fight for her honor?” Rhaenys asked as Aemond nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaena turned to her grandmother, who took the crown in her hands and slowly walked towards Aemond. Rhaenys held the crown above his head, </span>
<b>
<em>“protect my granddaughter,”</em>
</b>
<span> she whispered, </span>
<b>
<em>“you are the only one who can.”</em>
</b>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond looked up at her and nodded. Rhaenys smiled at him and slowly placed the crown on his head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hail King Aemond of House Targaryen!” The Queen Who Never Was cheered as Aemond stood up and so did Levana. The male stood in front of the Queen, who smiled at him warmly; Baela walked towards them with Dark Sister in hand before handing it to Levana.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond knelt in front of his wife as Levana took the sword in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“King Aemond,” Levana said, “I present to you Dark Sister, once wielded by Queen Visenya Targaryen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond held his hands, bowing his head as Levana placed the sword in his hands. The sword that was once wielded by the man she despised the most would now be wielded by the man that holds her heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>King Aemond lifted his head to look at his Queen. With a smile, he began:</span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>“I swear to ward Queen Levana Velaryon of House Targaryen, the First and Last of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men; Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, The Gold Queen, Patrono of the Iron Islands, the Free Cities, and Dorne; the Protector of the Realm and the Mother of Dragons.”</b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled as she gestured for her King to stand and face the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I present to you, King Aemond, my King,” Levana announced as the soldiers began to cheer along with the Lords and Ladies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond turned to his wife and held her hands in his, “I will see you at supper.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled and leaned towards her husband, placing a kiss on his cheek, “I love you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The King smiled and pulled his Queen into his arms. He placed a kiss on the top of her head as he embraced her tightly, “I love you, Eva.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a heavy heart, Levana pulled away from her husband to face the crowd. By now, the soldiers have assembled to face the throne and the Small Council took their place in front of their troops. The Queen looked at her allies one by one, keeping her emotions at bay as she did not know that the war could have in store for them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Today, we begin our march to King’s Landing,” Levana began, “if there is anyone who wishes to remove themselves from this war, now is your chance.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Great Hall was quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will assure that no harm will come to anyone who wishes to leave," Levana continued, "I give you my word." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once again, silence. Aemond looked around the room, then at his wife. He felt the tension in the air as Levana stepped away from the throne and made her way towards the middle of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Will you all fight for me, not as your Queen, but as your ally?" Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No one dared to respond. Instead, the sound of metal clashing against metal resounded through the hall. The soldier began to bang their fists against their chests, as the Gold Queen watched the others follow suit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For Queen Levana and for the Seven Kingdoms!” Ser Harrold raised his sword as Levana nodded at him. With a brave smile, the Queen began to make her way out of the Great Hall with her King following after her. Soon, soldiers began to pour out of the hall as they began their march to King’s Landing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queensguard followed Levana and Aemond as they made their way deeper into the castle where their dragons rested. Besian and Galatea retrieved their dragons beforehand as the former would lead the troops to the capital while the latter stationed herself outside the stronghold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they arrived, they were greeted by the sight of Lady Alicent. She stood at a distance from the dragons and she had tears falling down her face. Aemond and Levana turned to each other before walking towards her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once they were close enough, Alicent immediately wrapped her arms around the both of them. Her sobbing became more audible as she held them tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My children,” Alicent began, “please be safe and come back to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The tears that Levana couldn’t shed in the Great Hall began to pour as she wrapped an arm around the former Queen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll come back,” Levana promised, “we don’t know when but we will.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent broke their embrace before turning to Aemond; she placed a hand on his face as she embraced him again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva,” Alicent turned to her, “if you would allow it, I would like to speak to Aemond alone before you leave.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have to leave, mother,” Aemond said, “we can’t delay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s alright, Aemond,” Levana said with a smile, “we will not leave without you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That said, Levana began to walk towards her dragons as Aemond turned to his mother with a look of dismay in his eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Aemond asked, “what could be so important, mother?” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“It’s about your father.” </b>

<span>“The Golds are coming!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys rushed into the Great Hall where Rhaenyra was seated on the Iron Throne; a visible look of discomfort on her face. The prince approached his mother, who began to shout orders to their forces, instructing them to start preparing the soldiers and to fortify the walls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is also a riot happening in King’s Landing,” Jacaerys reported, “a man who calls himself Shepherd is rallying our people to bring down the Dragonpit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which dragons are in there now?” Rhaenyra asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vermax, Shrykos, Morghul, Tyraxes, and Dreamfyre, Your Grace,” Jacaerys said, “Syrax is in the skies.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any dragons from the Golds?” Rhaenyra asked, “your sister's dragons?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince shook his head, “we’ve only seen Grey Ghost, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra stood from the Iron Throne and began to make her way out of the Great Hall. Jacaerys followed after his mother, watching as those in the halls began to scramble to their posts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the day that Jacaerys was waiting for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Prince Jacaerys, take the City Watch with you,” Rhaenyra commanded, “the riot needs to be stopped and the dragons need to be protected.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys nodded as he bowed his head, “understood, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as the prince was about to turn his back to leave, Rhaenyra held his wrist tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If Levana comes,” the Black Queen looked into his son’s eyes, “retreat.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys was taken aback, “I can’t just retreat, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“You will retreat, Jacaerys,”</b>
<span> Rhaenyra said, placing her hands on either side of his son’s face,</span>
<b> “I cannot lose another child.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys shook his head, “I am a Targaryen Prince and I will not back down from this war.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We do not know what Levana is capable of,” Rhaenyra stated, “she killed Daemon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys took a deep breath. He saw the mixture of madness and sadness in his mother’s eyes - it almost looked pitiful. With a deep sigh, he nodded before the Black Queen placed a kiss on his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that you love your older sister,” Rhaenyra said, “but she is presently our enemy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince nodded plainly before turning his back. So many things were coming into play at once and more than anything, Jacaerys wasn’t about to let the opportunity to talk with his older sister pass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In this mind, there was still a way that this war would end peacefully and he was going to champion it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you going, Jace?” Joffrey asked, running up to his older brother who sighed deeply, “to see Ana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana’s here?” Joffrey asked excitedly, “I’ll come with you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys stopped. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“You will do no such thing,”</b>
<span> the older prince stated, </span>
<b>“you will stay here with the Queen.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“But--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t be accepting any reason for it, Joffrey,” Jacaerys sighed, “mother cannot lose us both." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Jace?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys smiled at his younger brother and pulled him into a tight embrace, "you will make a fine ruler, Joffrey." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before the younger prince could get a word out, Jacaerys quickly began to make his way towards the dungeons. He produced a key from his sleeve as he walked through the empty cells, stopping at the last one at the end of the hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grandsire?” Jacaerys called as Lord Corlys emerged from the darkness of his cell. The once proud Velaryon Lord was reduced to nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” Corlys asked, “what does your mother want with me now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys didn’t respond. Instead, he began to unlock the cell with the key, cussing to himself as he finally pulled the door of the cell open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana is coming,” Jacaerys stated, “please return to Driftmark, Grandsire.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Lord Corlys asked as he made his way out of the cell, “with what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is a boat on the dock that is waiting for you,” Jacaerys stated, “it’s a small boat but the sailor that I’ve employed will navigate you through Blackwater Bay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You and Joffrey?” Corlys asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need to stay,” Jacaerys stated, “I cannot leave my mother now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause before Lord Corlys wrapped his arms around Jacaerys, pulling him into an embrace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No matter what anyone has said,” Corlys began, “you are my grandson and you are of my blood.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the Velaryon Lord began to make his way out of the cellar, leaving Jacaerys behind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince smiled slightly before shaking his head and following after Lord Corlys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the time. </span>

<span>“Levana will not know about what you’ve told me,” Aemond stated as he turned his back on Alicent who looked at her son with worry</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She deserves to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn’t need to,” Aemond responded, “Levana will not know about this, do you understand, mother?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent could do nothing but nod as Aemond began to make his way towards Levana who was in the middle of adjusting her mount on Vermithor. Princess Rhaenys helped to adjust her riding gear as she watched Aemond approach them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The King is coming,” Rhaenys stated as she said, “will you tell him what you have revealed to me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head before facing her grandmother and wrapping her arms around her, “thank you for everything, grandma.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys could only smile as an overwhelming feeling of pride swelled in her chest as she wrapped her arms around Levana and placed a kiss on her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Make King Viserys proud,” Rhaenys whispered as Levana nodded and began to mount her dragon. Rhaenys watched as Cannibal and Silverwing took to the skies first as Aemond mounted Vhagar in silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead,” Levana stated as Aemond nodded plainly before commanding his mount to follow after the two dragons. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Even if Aemond chooses not to tell me,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana began, </span>
<em>
<span>“I already know and that doesn’t change anything.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys sighed and nodded. Levana ran a hand down Vermithor’s neck, taking a deep breath as her dragon bellowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Onwards, Vermithor,” Levana commanded as the Bronze Fury let out a mighty roar before spreading its wings to take flight. </span>

<p>
<span>King’s Landing was a short flight from Harrenhal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet, the Gold Queen felt that it must’ve been forever. She looked down from Vermithor and watched at the soldiers marching toward the capital - it was a sight to behold as a sea of red and gold marched through the path with banners of Houses Targaryen, Velaryon, Martell, Strong and Greyjoy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Targaryen banner of red, black, and gold flew high as Levana and Aemond flew ahead of them. Besian and Baela flew behind them as the Gold Queen took in a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond, secure Blackwater Bay,” Levana stated, “Baela and Besian, secure the parameter of King’s Landing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yourself?” Aemond asked, “surely you don’t plan on going there alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head, “I’ll have my Queensguard.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s only one of you,” Baela stated, “take me with you, sister.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen shook her head as she gestured for the three dragons flying above them, “I think you’re all forgetting that I have four dragons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The three riders beside Levana kept silent as the Queen looked at Aemond, “I’m not going to change my mind, at the moment, I need dragonriders to secure the perimeter because our soldiers will not be quick enough to spread out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As you wish, Your Grace,” Baela responded as she flew ahead of Besian, who bowed his head before following after the Velaryon lady. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Go, my king,"</span>
</em>
<span> Levana said as she turned to Aemond, </span>
<em>
<span>"the fleet needs you." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"If you think that, for a moment, I will leave you," </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond began, but he was interrupted by the bellow of Cannibal who then flew beside Vhagar. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Go," </span>
</em>
<span>Levana said, </span>
<em>
<span>"before my dragon decides to make a meal out of you."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond looked at his wife in disbelief, but followed orders, nonetheless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With her husband gone, Levana pushed towards the Dragonpit, jumping off of Vermithor when the dragon landed by the stronghold. The first that the Gold Queen noticed was the mob making its way towards the Dragonpit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were armed with what seemed like torches and blades - a sign that they were not there to simply seek refuge while her forces attacked the Blacks. The Queen took out the Conqueror’s Sword from its sheath before walking towards the main gate of the Dragonpit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She met the crowd halfway, standing tall as they stopped just a few feet away from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s the traitor,” a man in the front of the crowd shouted, “how are you coming back to King’s Landing?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you are?” Levana asked, “you are certainly no lord or soldier.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am the Shepherd,” the man revealed, “and we are here to purge the land of those vile creatures.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dragons are not vile,” the Gold Queen defended, “you are vile because you are rallying all these good people into a battle instead of allowing them to seek refuge.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t converse with traitors to the crown!” The Shepherd shouted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Killing these dragons will make </span>
<b>you </b>
<span>an enemy of the crown,” Levana stated, “and </span>
<b>I am the crown</b>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The crown is your mother,” one of the smallfolk responded, “you are the traitor to the crown!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not a traitor when my grandsire, King Viserys, wanted me to inherit the throne,” Levana shouted, taking Aegon’s Dagger from her waist and holding it up for everyone to see. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is Aegon the Conqueror’s dagger and embedded in it is his prophecy,” the Gold Queen shouted, “from his blood I will rise as the Queen who will save this realm from the cold and the dark.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are a fake,” The Shepherd shouted, “you are a fake Queen!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Levana was about to respond, Vermithor landed behind her - earning gasps from the crowd. Soon after, Silverwing, Sheepstealer, and Cannibal would join them; the three dragons perched on the stronghold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I were not meant to be the Queen,” Levana looked at her dragons and then at the crowd, “I would not have the power to control four dragons at once.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Witchcraft!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“”I will not allow you to risk the lives of </span>
<b>my people,</b>
<span>” Levana stated, “if you want to storm the Dragonpit, you will have to go through me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause as the crowd began to whisper among themselves. The Shepherd turned to them and then back at Levana who was glaring at him. From where she was standing, the Gold Queen could hear a mixture of conversations - from ones believing her to those asking how she could acquire her dragons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All seemed to be well until the Shepherd raised his blade, “you cannot believe this woman!” he shouted, “she cannot sit on the Iron Throne!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana took a deep breath, “if you do not believe that I can be Queen, that is fine,” she said, “but I will not allow you to bring harm to my people.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They do not care about you,” the Shepherd stated, “you are nothing but a fake.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It matters not to me if they care,” Levana said, “I will not allow harm to come to them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is right!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud voice said from behind the crowd as the smallfolk began to move away, allowing a tall figure to march towards Levana.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lord Corlys walked to his granddaughter with his sword drawn, “she might not be the Queen that we expected but she is the one that will save our realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled at her grandsire, quickly sheathing her blades and running towards him to embrace him tightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, Ana,” Lord Corlys whispered, “I wish I arrived sooner.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do not have to apologize, grandsire,” Levana responded, “you have done nothing wrong.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you forgive me for lifting a sword to you?” Lord Corlys asked as the Gold Queen nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are on my side,” Levana stated, “that’s all that matters.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smallfolk watched on as the Velaryons reunited. The Shepherd, on the other hand, grunted in anger as he rushed towards Levana, shouting the names of the gods. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“In the name of the Seven,”</b>
<span> the Shepherd shouted, </span>
<b>“you will die today!” </b>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Levana stood tall as The Shepherd began to run towards her with his blade drawn; the Queen looked at him and sighed as Sheepstealer quickly blocked his path, roaring at the man who tried to attack the dragon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you see now?!” The Shepherd shouted, “these creatures need to be killed!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you lack common sense?” Levana raised a brow, “you attacked his master, how could it not be angry?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Shepherd remained quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If this is the man that you have decided to follow,” Levana took a deep breath, “then King's Landing will truly not survive.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd muttered among themselves as Lord Corlys approached The Shepherd and took the blade from his hands. The Velaryon Lord then held the latter’s hands behind his back before escorting him to the side, allowing his granddaughter to walk toward the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was born in King's Landing, nearly three tens of moons ago,” Levana began, “as a child, I have always wondered what it looked like beyond the walls of the Red Keep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smallfolk listened intently as Levana sheathed her sword, “I might not have been able to live among you but at least allow me to live with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd just looked at her in awe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to save this place that I grew up in,” Levana continued, “I want to save the place where I married the man that I loved and where my children were born.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd’s expression began to soften as the Gold Queen bowed her head slightly, “allow me to serve you as your Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was silence as the crowd began to step to the side, making way for the Velaryon Queen to walk into the capital. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vermithor,” Levana called as the Bronze Fury flew from the roof of the Dragonpit and landed behind his rider. The Queen looked at the crowd one more time before turning her back and walking towards the dragon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Queen Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned around to see a child walking towards her with a string of flowers in her hands. Amongst the crowd, a young child - not more than six - was the first to approach the Gold Queen. The former responded to the child by walking towards her and bending the knee to meet her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not a noble,” the child began as she held out the string of flowers to the Queen, “but please take this with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana’s eyes softened as she held back tears before bowing her head. The child placed the string of flowers around the Queen’s neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You remind me of my daughter,” Levana smiled to herself, “you remind me so much of my Aemma,” she whispered as she placed a hand on the child’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stay safe,” the Queen whispered before getting up and mounting Vermithor. Lord Corlys looked at his granddaughter and nodded to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When this war ends, grandsire,” Levana spoke, “history will remember me as the </span>
<b>first and only </b>
<span>Velaryon Queen to command the Iron Throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>At the statement, Lord Corlys’ eyes widened while Vermithor took to the skies. Sheepstealer, Silverwing, and Cannibal followed after the Gold Queen. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sheepstealer, go to Blackwater Bay,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana commanded, </span>
<em>
<span>“Silverwing, I need you to make sure that the capital is secured.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The two dragons bellowed and separated from the crowd, leaving Cannibal and Vermithor to fly towards the Red Keep. As Levana wasn’t about to jump off her dragon, the Bronze Fury crashed through the stained glass windows of the Red Keep’s throne room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The dragon landed in front of the Iron Throne as Cannibal took its place through the window, blocking light from entering the room with its wings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana unmounted from Vermithor to be greeted by her </span>
<em>
<span>mother </span>
</em>
<span>who was walking towards her with a sword in hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Queen Rhaenyra.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I am very much impressed by this stunt that you have managed to pull,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra stated as the Gold Queen unsheathed the Conqueror’s Sword. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“How did you do it, daughter?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You do not deserve to call me that,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana glared, </span>
<em>
<span>“not with everything that I have had to suffer because of the decisions that you made.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra attempted to approach further, but Vermithor was quick to snap his neck towards the Black Queen. The former moved a few steps back before turning to Levana again; the Gold Queen placed a hand on her dragon’s neck as Rhaenyra watched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It amazes me that you can control three dragons,” Rhaenyra said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Four,” Levana corrected, “I took Sheepstealer after we got rid of the dragonseed that you sent to take Pyke.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a pitiful attempt,” Rhaenyra admitted, “I thought we would have the upper hand, but I was still wrong.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could’ve killed another grandchild if you had taken Pyke,” Levana stated, “you could have killed my daughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra’s eyes turned into a mixture of rage and longing as she took a deep breath, “why is it that the gods seem to grant you with everything that I want?” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Because unlike you, I wasn’t selfish,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana stated, </span>
<em>
<span>“the only selfish decision that I made was to marry Aemond.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“When was I ever selfish, Levana?” Rhaenyra asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was pure rage in Levana’s eyes as she began to walk towards the Black Queen, Vermithor stalked after his rider. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Repeat the question, </span>
<b>mother</b>
<span>,” Levana deadpanned, “look me in the eye and repeat what you just said.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“When have I ever been selfish?” </b>
<span>Rhaenyra asked, “everything that I’ve done was for you and your brothers, why are you blind to that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana took a deep breath as her dragons began to get riled up; Vermithor inched his head closer to his rider as Cannibal let out a loud roar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was abandoned when I was nine,” Levana began, “I was raised by my grandmother while I endlessly tried to defend my mother and brothers for everything that is thrown towards them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra kept silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I defended myself and you,” Levana stated, “I had no one to help me defend myself except my husband and my grandsire.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cannibal began to spread its wings as it inched its body closer into the Great Hall. Vermithor, on the other hand, bellowed as Levana continued to walk towards Queen Rhaenyra. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I lost both my children,”</b>
<span> the Gold Queen continued, </span>
<b>“I lost my brothers because of you.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra glared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you dare tell me that you aren’t selfish,” Levana hissed, “because all of this happened because of your selfishness.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cannibal and Vermithor roared loudly as Levana raised her sword toward Queen Rhaenyra, “this ends now, Queen Rhaenyra.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish it didn’t have to,” Rhaenyra said as she raised her sword as well, “this is not how I wanted this to end, Levana.” </span>

<span>Aemond and Vhagar seized whatever they could of the Velaryon Fleet in Blackwater Bay. They tried to keep most of the fleet a float but they couldn’t extend the same courtesy to the ships that sent arrows towards them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With the help of Levana’s dragons, Blackwater Bay was secure, and King Aemond made the decision to help evacuate the capital. As he flew towards the Red Keep, he was intercepted by Silverwing. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I need to make sure that she’s alright,” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond tried to reason with Silverwing who growled at him, </span>
<em>
<span>“let me see her.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Silverwing blocked Vhagar and Aemond’s path to the Red Keep, determined to keep them away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond turned to see Vermax flying towards them. The King could only raise a brow as Jacaerys and his dragon flew beside him and his own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let Ana handle this,” Jacaerys stated, “she’s capable.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that my wife is capable,” Aemond responded, “but your mother is mad.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Don't say that about my mother!" Jacaerys responded, "this is their battle, Aemond, and provocation will get you nowhere." </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no desire to provoke you, </span>
<em>
<span>brother,</span>
</em>
<span>” Aemond stated, “we both want to protect Levana and right now, she is alone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys shook his head, “Ana isn’t alone, she has her dragons and the least you could do is help me evacuate the city before my mother orders the destruction of this city!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Aemond asked, “what are you talking about?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If she loses to Levana, my mother ordered for the city to be burned to the ground,” Jacaerys stated, “I wasn’t there when she made the decree but the soldiers spoke of it and they’re preparing for the destruction of King’s Landing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, there is only one thing to do,” Aemond grinned, “I suppose you know where the cannons or whatever the weapons are being kept?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother planned to use the dragons,” Jacaerys revealed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond smiled as he began to fly toward the Dragonpit. Jacaerys watched in disbelief before commanding his dragon to follow after the Gold King. </span>

</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen panted as she gripped the hilt of her sword tighter. She looked at her </span>
<em>
<span>mother</span>
</em>
<span> who was standing just in front of the Iron Throne before running towards her, lifting her sword as she prepared to attack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra on the other hand, was able to block Levana’s attack with her own sword. However, Levana was much stronger than her and the force of their collision forced her to take a few steps back. The Black Queen lost her balance and fell onto the Iron Throne. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana watched as her mother winced in pain as soon as she came into contact with the Iron Throne. Rhaenyra lifted her hand to reveal a trail of blood running down from her finger down to her forearm. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The throne rejected you,” </span>

</p><p>
<em>
<span>“She who has to call herself the Queen is no Queen at all,”</span>

<span>“It was in disarray when your grandsire died,” Rhaenyra stated, “I am here to fix this realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Levana spat, “you further pushed it into ruin.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What have I done to earn your ire?” Rhaenyra asked, “you were the apple of my eye, Ana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana sheathed her sword and walked towards her mother. She stood on the steps of the Iron Throne and watched as Rhaenyra frantically tried to wrap her wound with a fabric from her dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was willing to put our differences aside,” Levana began, “but you’ve given me enough reason to believe that you did not want to mend bonds with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra’s head snapped towards Levana. She would never admit it, but Rhaenyra missed being called that by her </span>
<em>
<span>only </span>
</em>
<span>daughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I married Daemon so I would have a proper King Consort by my side when I took the throne,” Rhaenyra stated, “I didn’t mean for you to be collateral to my goals.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet look what happened with you married Daemon,” Levana sighed, “I lost my children and I lost the only parent that I thought I had left.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Rhaenyra stood up from the throne, “we can stop this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It won’t stop until you give the throne to me, mother,” Levana said, “I can fix this ruin.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you didn’t want the throne,” Rhaenyra said, “why now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never really did,” Levana responded as she looked upon Vermithor and Cannibal, “but I was told that I was to be the Queen who will save this realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“By whom?” Rhaenyra asked, “is this another lie that Alicent told you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My grandparents spoke of it,” Levana stated, “‌my visions and my dreams are what brought me here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra walked closer to her daughter, prompting Levana to walk a couple of steps back as she once again unsheathed her sword. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your visions will be the death of you,” Rhaenyra laughed as she began to carelessly swing her sword. Levana tried to avoid her, trying her best to match her mother’s pace as her dragons became more alert of the situation. Vermithor raised his head, breaking columns as he did so while Cannibal made more damage on top of the Iron Throne. </span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“You might as well join your grandparents,</em>
</b>
<b>”</b>
<span> Rhaenyra bitterly said as she managed to get closer to Levana, </span>
<b>
<em>“after all, you seem to have more of an attachment to them than I.</em>
</b>
<b>”</b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana huffed as she began to retaliate, delivering heavier swings. She was much faster than the Black Queen but the latter was relentless in her pursuit. Rhaenyra would continue to swing her sword and follow after the Gold Queen in large strides so she could make up for speed - something that she didn’t have because of age. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen tried her best to avoid Rhaenyra with little to no damage to herself but the attempt served to be futile when she heard Cannibal shriek followed by the apparent traces of fire. Levana turned towards the skies and saw that Syrax was now engaged in battle with her dragon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fearing for the worst, Levana turned to Vermithor, </span>
<em>
<span>“go, help Cannibal!” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Though reluctant, the Bronze Fury made its way out of the Great Hall to assist in battling Syrax. Levana continued to engage in battle with Queen Rhaenyra; her blows getting harder and harder - she intended for the both of them to come out alive, but it was clear to her that the latter did not have the same intentions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra and her were now in a fight to the death.</span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">【𝟏𝟎𝟒】</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Their fight went on - stopping only when Queen Rhaenyra wasn’t able to retaliate against a strong blow from Levana which sent her to her knees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop this!” Levana pleaded, “I don’t want to kill you.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The only way that you’re sitting on the Iron Throne will be through my dead body!” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra responded furiously as she charged towards Levana. The Gold Queen dodged her attack, delivering another heavy blow; knocking the sword out of Rhaenyra’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned towards the door of the Great Hall to see Jacaerys. Almost too quickly, the Gold Queen ran towards her younger brother - embracing him tightly, dropping her sword in the process. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” Levana asked as she broke the embrace, inspecting her younger brother for any wounds, “where’s Joffrey?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Joffrey is safe,” Jacaerys responded, “Aemond and I evacuated him as well as Grandsire and the other dragons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Levana asked as Jacaerys watched their mother. Rhaenyra just watched their interaction as the Velaryon male held Levana’s hand in his. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother intends to lay waste to King’s Landing,” Jacaeys revealed, “we evacuated all the dragons and Aemond is making sure that the city is evacuated right now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lay waste…?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana trailed off as she turned to face Queen Rhaenyra, “is this your definition of defending the realm?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I only intended to lay waste to the capital if I had lost to you!” Rhaenyra stated, “you cannot rule ashes, Levana,” she laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother,” Jacaerys pleaded, “we have to stop this madness.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rhaenyra responded as she stood up, “this madness will not stop unless one of us dies!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jacaerys looked at the two women and shook his head, “she’s my sister!” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“She is no daughter of mine,”</b>
<span> Rhaenyra scoffed, </span>
<b>“what kind of daughter would go against her own mother?!” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“The one that you have wronged,” Levana glared at her, “the one who had to suffer the consequences to everything that you did!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve lost Lucerys, my sons, my daughters, and Daemon!” Rhaenyra shouted, “what have you lost?!” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I’ve lost my grandsire,” </b>
<span>Levana began, </span>
<b>“I lost my brothers, my children, and I’ve lost you.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra paused. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I only ever wanted to be by your side,”</b>
<span> Levana continued, </span>
<b>“I just wanted my family to be complete.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother,” Jacaerys turned to Rhaenyra, “declare Ana as Queen and step down from the throne to put a stop to this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Rhaenyra responded, “she will either execute me or throw me into a cell.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will be tried fairly, Queen Rhaenyra,” Levana stated, “I will not let death cast its shadow upon you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra chuckled, “I have no doubt that you are capable of more.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just, please,” Levana sighed, “let’s put an end to this madness.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana and Jacaerys walked towards Rhaenyra. There was an unmistakable look of nostalgia and melancholy in the Black Queen’s eyes as they approached her. For a while, she imagined them as children - it made her smile slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Seeing Levana and Jacaerys as younger versions of themselves made her start to sob - shocking the siblings as the prince knelt beside his mother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Rhaenyra mumbled through her tears, “I wanted to protect all of you and our legacy that I fixated everything towards the Iron Throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana was taken aback. In her mind, it’s either the Black Queen was truly genuine or she had gone completely mad. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You deserved so much more, Ana,” Rhaenyra looked at the Gold Queen, “I wanted to give you everything that you deserved on a silver platter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would’ve denied,” Levana stated, “what’s the point of having the Iron Throne if I didn’t prove to anyone that I deserved it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Had I raised you, that wouldn’t have been your answer.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then I’m glad that you didn’t,” Levana said bluntly, “because I wanted to prove my worth to the realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve already done that by becoming Vermithor’s rider,” Rhaenyra chuckled, “and by claiming the rest of the dragons residing in Dragonstone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not claim them,” Levana corrected, “they claimed me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your way of thinking amuses me,” Rhaenyra chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Having more than one dragon wouldn’t have been possible if you raised me,” Levana stated, “I would’ve only had Vermithor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose the world had more to offer you when you left my wing,” Rhaenyra took a deep breath as Levana turned her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Surrender, Queen Rhaenyra,” Levana said firmly, “and I will see to it that you will have fair judgment during trial.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Black Queen kept silent as Jacaerys helped his mother to stand firmly. Once he was sure that the Queen was alright, he began to walk behind Levana. The sight of her children walking away from her struck a nerve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was as though the Black Queen experienced a catharsis like no other. She began to walk behind them, slowly. Jacaerys would look behind him every now and then to make sure that his mother was okay before catching up to his sister. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly but surely, Rhaenyra bent down to pick her sword up, holding it tightly in her hand as she approached them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will never bend the knee,” Rhaenyra said under her breath as Levana stopped in her tracks. She turned to see that the Black Queen was now holding the sword and there was an unmistakable aura of anger that exuded from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jace,” Levana said, “get out of here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to leave you behind,” Jacaerys stated as Rhaenyra began to approach them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve lost Lucerys,” Rhaenyra began, “lost Aegon and Viserys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana quickly picked up the Conqueror’s Sword from the ground and stood in front of Jacaerys who watched as his mother, in her own madness, approached them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve lost Daemon,” Rhaenyra laughed, “I will not lose the Iron Throne to a Hightower wench like you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hightower wench?!” Levana raised a brow, “you were the one who betrothed me to Aemond!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to use you as a pawn,” Rhaenyra grinned, “I wanted to use your marriage with my half brother as a way to rid the Seven Kingdoms from them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon and Aemond have done nothing to you,” Levana stated, “whatever war you have, you owe it to Otto and Lady Alicent.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should’ve killed them when I had the chance,” Rhaenyra gritted her teeth, “I should have poisoned all of them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then what?” Levana asked, “live a life with the moniker of kinslayer?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just like your husband?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He didn’t kill Luke.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps he didn’t,” Rhaenyra smirked, “but you did.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t kill my own brother!” Levana defended, “I tried to protect him!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But you could’ve stopped Aemond,” Rhaenyra responded, “you could’ve stopped my wretched brother from pursuing Lucerys!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You weren’t supposed to make them your soldiers!” Levana argued, “they are your children, they aren’t soldiers!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve heard the last from you!” Rhaenyra said, “you will die here!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything happened all too quickly. The last thing that Levana heard was the sound of blade clashing against blade and the sound of her younger brother screaming her name. She was in a daze as she watched Queen Rhaenyra charge towards her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She held a protective stance as she braced herself from the attack. At the speed that Queen Rhaenyra was going, Levana wouldn’t have time to react and have a proper swing. She took a deep breath as the Black Queen charged with all her might. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“Levana!” </b>

<p>
<span>Levana didn’t have the time to react when she saw that her brother had run in front of her. She didn’t even have the luxury of time to register the look on Rhaenyra’s face when Jacaerys began to fall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen cried loudly as she took her younger brother in her arms, tears falling down her cheeks as she sank to her knees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jace,” Levana called as she held her brother’s hand, “please, Jace, stay awake.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Jacaerys lifted his head to look at her sister and smiled slightly, “I never got to meet your daughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s why you have to stay awake, Jacaerys,” Levana choked on a sob as she looked at the wound. It appeared to be too deep and while she would have attempted to pull the blade from Jacaerys’ side, she feared that it might have lodged too deep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana, please look after Baela and Rhaena,” Jacaerys requested, “you and Joffrey are the only ones that they have left.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded as she hugged her brother tighter, “Jace, I’m sorry,” she apologized, “I’m sorry that I was never there for you when you needed me the most.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not your fault,” Jacaerys responded, “you did what was right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The prince winced in pain as Levana sobbed, “please, Jacaerys, don’t do this to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Jacaerys laughed heartily, “someone has to look after Lucerys in the next life.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen could only watch as life left her younger brother’s body. Jacaerys, who was just laughing moments ago, fell limp in Levana’s arms as she cried into her brother’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra couldn’t move as she watched them. Watching as Jacaerys took his last breath in Levana’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“Jacaerys loved you dearly,” </em>
</b>
<span>Rhaenyra said, </span>
<b>
<em>“all he ever wanted was for us to reconcile.”</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve taken Jacaerys away from me too,” Levana glared at Queen Rhaenyra before setting her brother’s corpse gently on the ground. She picked up the Conqueror’s Sword and began to make her way towards the Black Queen who looked up at her with sorrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra took one last look at Jacaerys before shifting her position so that she was kneeling in front of Levana. The Gold Queen watched as the other Targaryen looked up at her again. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“I surrender,”</b>
<span> Rhaenyra began, </span>
<b>“I have nothing left.”</b>
</p><p>
<span>“Come with me and I will see to it that you are tried fairly,” Levana said but Rhaenyra chuckled and shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I have killed my two sons,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra admitted, </span>
<em>
<span>“the blood of Lucerys and Jacaerys Velaryon are on my hands.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana could only stare as Rhaenyra continued. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The blood of Aemma and Baelon Targaryen are also on my hands,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra stated, </span>
<em>
<span>“that is a fact.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“What would you have me do?” Levana asked as Rhaenyra turned her gaze towards the sword in the former’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“You know what you have to do.” </em>
</b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana took a deep breath before looking at the sword and nodding. There was a long pause as Queen Rhaenyra smiled at Levana, </span>
<em>
<span>“will you grant me one last request?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“If it is in my power,” Levana responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you call me mother one last time?” Rhaenyra asked, “will you grant me that selfish request?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana thought for a while before shaking her head, </span>
<b>“the mother that I once had in you is long gone and you are no mother of mine.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenyra nodded simply as Levana raised her sword. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m proud of you, Levana,” Rhaenyra spoke as she bowed her head. The Gold Queen choked back on a sob as she brought down her sword with a force that she didn’t even know she had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crown of King Jaehaerys fell first, rolling towards Levana’s feet as watched while Queen Rhaenyra’s body fell and her head rolled to the side of her lifeless body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana fell to her knees and shouted towards the heavens. From afar, she could hear her dragons roar as well - many more followed at what she could just assume were the other dragons in King’s Landing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Syrax appeared by the Iron Throne and slowly made its way towards Levana, sneering at the sight of her lifeless rider. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Levana looked into Syrax’s eyes as the dragon bellowed before lowering its neck. The Gold Queen reached out and placed a hand on the she-dragon’s snout before standing up. She picked up her grandsire’s crown and mounted Syrax, instructing the dragon to take to the skies. As Syrax flew out of the Red Keep, Levana looked at the bodies left in the throne room before closing her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She would give them the burial that they deserved later but there were things to be done first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was a loud cry that erupted from the Great Hall. Aemond heard it from the skies, prompting him to fly towards the gaping hole left by Vermithor and Cannibal by the Red Keep’s throne room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold King’s eyes widened in shock as he saw his Queen kneeling on the ground with Jacaerys in her arms. The Black Queen stood by them, her sword discarded on the ground as she slowly sank to her knees. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond commanded Vhagar to fly towards the Dragonpit with Lord Corlys stood with Ser Harrold and Ser Qarl. Before unmounting from his dragon, the Gold King watched as more of their banners entered the city - at the very least, they could conquer the capital.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s the Queen?” Ser Qarl asked Aemond who unmounted from Vhagar. There was a long pause between the men before the Targaryen king walked to Lord Corlys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jacaerys,” Aemond said, “he’s dead.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lord Corlys was taken aback. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Levana wouldn't let that happen," Lord Corlys approached Aemond before placing his hands on his shoulders, "tell me the truth of it, boy!" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond sighed deeply, "Prince Jacaerys Velaryon was killed by Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen." </span>
</p><p>
<span>The revelation took all of them by surprise. The Black Queen has truly gone mad. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I will tell the fleet," Lord Corlys stepped away, holding back tears, "House Velaryon surrenders to the Gold Queen." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded before turning to Sirl Qarl, "have the maesters send ravens to Lady Jeyne Arryn and to the other houses who supported the Black Queen." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"What shall we inform them of, My King?" Ser Harrold asked as Daemon took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"The Black Queen bent the knee to the Gold Queen and gave herself to Queen Levana's sword." </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two knights nodded before bowing their hands. Aemond mounted Vhagar once again, bracing himself to deliver the news to their House. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone will have to send word to House Stark as well,” Lord Corlys said, “he was Rhaenyra’s strongest ally.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded as Vhagar spread her wings, “I’ll go.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not going anywhere.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond watched as Syrax landed in front of Vhagar - Levana’s other dragons followed after as the Gold Queen unmounted from Rhaeynra’s dragon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You will see to it that the fighting in King’s Landing and all other areas are done,” Levana ordered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you?” Lord Corlys asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be the one to inform Lord Cregan that Queen Rhaenyra is dead,” Levana stated before turning her back and walking towards Vermithor who lowered its neck for his rider. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva-” Aemond was cut off by his wife’s cold stare. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“That is an order from the Queen.”</b>

<p>
<span>Winterfell was unlike anything that Levana imagined. It was definitely different from all the stories that she’s heard before but there was also something mystical about it that drew her in - maybe it was the landscape or the mystery behind it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor landed in front of Winterfell Castle and as Levana expected, her welcome would not be warm as she was surrounded by the soldiers of House Stark as she unmounted from her dragon who bellowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Gold Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked up and nodded her head to acknowledge Lord Cregan Stark who was making his way towards her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What brings you to Winterfell?” Cregan asked, “surely you're not here to champion for Queen Rhaenyra.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s dead,” Levana revealed, “she bent the knee and gave herself to judgment for the blood of Lucerys and Jacaerys Velaryon as well as that of Aemma and Baelon Targaryen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd fell silent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why have you come?” Cregan asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve come to say that you are in no way obligated to swear to me,” Levana stated, “I will not consider you an enemy and I will not consider you an ally.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You would do that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As I have with all those who swore to my banner,” Levana stated, “you are free to choose which Queen you will serve.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the Gold Queen turned her back to the Lord of Winterfell and mounted her dragon again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Surely you didn’t come just to stay that?” Cregan asked, “your brother stayed for wine and a meal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alas,” Levana smiled slightly, “I am not my brother and I have more things to do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“More important than dining with a potential ally?” Cregan asked, “it amazes me how you could employ the help of your sworn houses and the Triarchy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lord Cregan,” Levana cleared her throat, “I mean no disrespect, but the realm, as it is now, is in disarray and I have to fix it before it goes further into ruin.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor bellowed as he spread his wings. The Targaryen Queen looked towards the Lord again and smiled, “the gates of King’s Landing and the Red Keep will welcome you, Lord Cregan, should you decide to journey south when everything has been sorted.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your coronation, perhaps?” Cregan asked as Levana smiled at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When we celebrate the rebirth of the realm,” Levana said as Vermithor speared out of Winterfell and into the skies. The Stark watched as the Bronze Fury began to disappear into the clouds - smiling to himself before making his way back into the castle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you not intend to ask for Queen Levana’s hand in marriage, My Lord?” Asked one of the maesters as Cregan shook his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I intended to, yes,” Cregan looked at the ceiling - memories of a few years past rushing to him as he let out a hearty laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was as beautiful as the day I first saw her,” Cregan smiled to himself, “we were much younger then, of course, and it was her tenth Name Day.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could argue that King Aemond once betrayed her trust,” the Maester said, “otherwise, why would the King stay in the Red Keep for months while the Queen came to the Iron Islands.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“We have no proof,”</b>
<span> Cregan responded,</span>
<b> “and why would I want to come in between a marriage that the gods approved of themselves?” </b>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the Lord of Winterfell retreated towards the Great Hall of his castle - devising a plan that would ultimately lead to his march towards King’s Landing under the banner of Queen Levana Velaryon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My King,” Rhaenys said as she approached Aemond, who stood by the Dragonpit with Lord Laenor. The Queen’s Hand was instructed to make her way to King’s Landing as soon as Rhaenyra and Aegon’s soldiers were dealt with and taken into custody. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Princess Rhaenys,” Aemond greeted, “it brings me joy that you’ve come to join us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys smiled slightly, “our troops have informed me that Prince Joffrey is safe and I’ve arranged for this transfer to Harrenhal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond looked at the princess with a relieved expression, “the Queen will be pleased to hear that he is safe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speaking of the Queen,” Rhaenys began, “where is she?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Winterfell,” Laenor intervened, “she should be on her way back as we speak.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys nodded before turning her gaze towards the Red Keep, “did she leave directives on what to do with the bodies of Rhaenyra and Jacaerys?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor shook his head, “according to the King, she left in a hurry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She would likely want to wrap Jacaerys’ body,” Aemond said, “I’m not so sure with my sister.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rhaenyra is a Targaryen and we will give her a proper burial,” Rhaenys said, “regardless of what she has done.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Would the Queen allow Jacaerys to be buried as Velaryons were intended?" Lord Corlys asked, "would it be selfish of me to ask of that?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys shook her head, "she is reasonable and her brothers stood as proud members of House Velaryon." </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause as Aemond looked towards Kings' Landing. He was, of course, relieved that the city didn't need to fall before Rhaenyra bent the knee but there was still the fact that his brother hasn't been found. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond did not see Aegon as a threat but rather, his Hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We need to find Aegon and Cole," Aemond stated, "if they are still out there then my Queen will not be safe still." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Laenor and Rhaenys looked at each other before the former nodded in acknowledgment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"At once, Your Grace," Laenor stated as he bowed his head before leaving to find the Queensguard and issue a directive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Your Grace," Rhaenys began, "if I may?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond turned to her and nodded. Rhaenys approached him and stood by his side — glancing at the city. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Ana will need you now more than ever," Rhaenys said, "the realm will still expect a King rather than a Queen and you will have to stand up for her."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond knew that much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While Levana has more than proven her worth to the realm, there will still be those who will question her strength. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I know," Aemond took a deep breath, "and I will be prepared to stand by her until the end."</span>

<p>
<span>“Have we found Aegon yet?” Levana asked as she looked towards her advisers, who shook their heads in response.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any correspondence from Dragonstone?” Aemond asked, “you can’t tell me that they haven’t even seen Cole?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Criston Cole </span>
<b>
<em>was </em>
</b>
<span>spotted at Dragonstone, Your Grace,” Grand Maester Priamos stated, “but these are just sightings and this was weeks ago when the siege of the capital happened.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana leaned against her chair as she looked at her Small Council. There was a small pause before the Gold Queen sighed and shook her head, “I will go to Dragonstone myself within the week.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace!” Ser Nandor spoke, “it’s dangerous.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How so?” Levana asked, “there have been no uprisings since we took King’s Landing and most of the Houses that swore to Rhaenyra and Aegon have already pledged loyalty to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Save the travels for after you’ve been crowned,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenys said, </span>
<em>
<span>“this way, we can be sure that you will be safe.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We don’t have enemies anymore,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana responded, </span>
<em>
<span>“I have my dragons.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I will go and escort the Queen,” </span>
</em>
<span>Aemond volunteered.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No,” </span>
</em>
<span>Levana responded, </span>
<em>
<span>“you’re staying because no one will be left to the Red Keep if I fly to Dragonstone.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva-” Aemond was cut off by his wife’s glare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Orders from the Queen,” Levana responded as she turned her attention to her Small Council again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are having the coronation in the coming week, yes?” Levana asked, “are any Lords and Ladies arriving soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lord Cregan Stark is on his way, Your Grace,” Maester Priamos said, “we also have Lord Borros coming from the Stormlands.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana kept silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lord Borros will answer to me before anything else,” Levana said, “his treatment towards my younger brother, Lucerys, is unacceptable.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it matter if it’s brought up?” Prince Sorin asked, “it won’t matter, would it, My Queen?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It matters to me,” Levana stated, “and he also proposed that my husband take a mistress, therefore, he will answer to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which one of Lord Borros’ daughters is fit to take his place?” Levana asked, “I will not hear objections on this matter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Elanda Baratheon is married to Lord Borros,” Rhaenys stated, “we can offer regency to her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, she will rule the Stormlands,” Levana stated, “provided that she will swear to me as her Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That, we shall find out when they arrive,” Laenor stated, “there is also a question of your unwed sisters, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will not have them marry Lords that they do not wish to marry,” Levana said, “I will not force them into marriages to fortify this House.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace--” Laenor took a deep breath, “we need sworn Houses.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I united Westeros, the Free Cities, and Dorne without the need to force anyone into it or tie anyone with marriage,” Levana stated, “I love my sisters and I will not force them to marry for my sake.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause as the members of Levana’s Small Council kept silent. Galatea watched from her seat with an amused smile on her face. Indeed, the young princess that she had taken care of as a babe is now fit to rule in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not force anyone to swear under my cause,” Levana reminded, “and I will continue to exercise and extend this freedom as I rule.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Aemond was about to react, there was a knock upon the door of the Chambers as it opened ever so slightly to reveal Joffrey with Aegon and Viserys in tow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s time, Your Grace,” Joffrey said gleefully as Levana stood up from her seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This meeting is adjourned,” Levana stated, “we shall reconvene tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you off to, Your Grace?” Aemond asked as Levana walked towards her younger brother and </span>
<em>
<span>their </span>
</em>
<span>sons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I promised them that I would take a walk with them,” Levana said, “this is an appointment that I unfortunately cannot miss,” she looked towards her council and nodded her head at them before Joffrey took his older sister’s hand and led her out of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are there really no uprisings?” Aemond asked, “what happened to the few who remained loyal to Rhaenyra?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gone,” Prince Sorin responded, “they will not be missed and those who have replaced them have sent word that they would swear to the Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does the Queen know that people have been killed?” Aemond asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it matter, My King?” Prince Sorin asked, “those who tried to cause uprisings will not be missed and their Houses are already under the helm of Queen Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Cole?” The King asked, “surely you don’t expect me to believe that we haven’t seen him since.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is our strongest belief that Cole and Aegon are in Dragonstone as the Keepers there noticed signs of life in the castle,” Ser Harrold stated, “Ser Nandor and Ser Qarl are presently scouting the area.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Moreover,” Lady Nesrin leaned her back against her chair, “I do believe that the Queen is going to rearrange our positions within the Small Council.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trust that it’s not going to change that much,” Lord Laenor stated, “Queen Levana is set on keeping those who stood by her side during the war in the Small Council.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard that she was planning to add the Lady of the Eyrie,” Prince Sorin stated, “how much of it is true, Your Graces?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond shook his head, “it’s not true.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys nodded, “while they might share blood through Queen Aemma, Lady Jeyne did not support the Gold Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have yet to confirm her support now,” Lord Laenor said, “but as the Queen instructed, we will not force anyone to swear under House Targaryen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea smiled, “it seems like it was only yesterday when she was the Gold Queen and now she is House Targaryen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chuckled to himself before making his way towards the door, “if that is all, My Lords and Ladies, I will be at the Godswood with my daughter,” he said with a small smile before walking out of the Chambers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One thing is for sure,” Prince Sorin chuckled, “they are amazing parents.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It brings me great joy to see them like that,” Rhaenys said with a sigh, “given that both of them did not have the best support systems growing up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace,” Lady Nesrin called, “if I may?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speak freely,” Rhaenys nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now that Queen Levana and the King have adopted Princes Aegon and Viserys, where does that put them in the line of succession?” Nesrin asked, “surely the Queen doesn’t mean to disinherit Princess Rhaenys the Younger.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys shook her head, “my granddaughter will remain her heir and if she cannot, I believe that Aegon will inherit after.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And if they have other children?” Prince Sorin asked, “what then?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then Aegon and Viserys will be further pushed back in the line of succession,” Laenor responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What will the children say, I wonder?” Lady Nesrin mused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Queen and the King will raise them right,” Rhaenys stated, “Levana’s claim to the throne was always subject to argument as she grew up so I believe that she will adequately prepare her children for their time to rule.” </span>

<p>
<span>“Queen Levana Velaryon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Targeryen Queen turned to face her husband who walked towards her and Vermithor with a torch in hand. The Bronze Fury bellowed at the sight of the King who simply took a step back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you here, Aemond?” Levana asked, “I thought you were in a deep sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was never asleep,” Aemond confessed, “I noticed how often you stirred and kept a close eye on you the entire night until you found your way to the Dragonpit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The female cussed under her breath before sighing, “I couldn’t find sleep at the off chance that Aegon could still be alive.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If he were, what do you intend to do?” Aemond asked, “he’d honestly be better off dead at his condition.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is still your brother,” Levana reminded, “he is still family.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Brother?” Aemond scoffed, “he saw nothing but ruin for this House.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana kept silent as she stroked Vermithor’s neck, “he needs to be found lest someone decides to claim the throne in his name.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The only claimants that he has are his children,” Aemond said, “I doubt Helaena desires the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not Helaena.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond’s eyes shot wide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mean my mother?” Aemond asked, “we are over this, Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that we are,” Levana said, “but is she?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you not trust Lady Alicent?” Aemond probed, “she’s been loyal to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that she has, but she was also loyal to Aegon,” Levana reminded, “and Aegon is her son.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What would you have me do?” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“Fly with me.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>With a grin, Levana mounted her dragon and commanded for it to take to the skies. Aemond grunted in disbelief before making his way towards his own dragon. The Targaryen King cussed under his breath as Vhagar took to the skies, following after Vermithor, who was flying away from King’s Landing toward Dragonstone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Levana!” Aemond called, “this is going to get us in trouble with your Small Council!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The most that they can do is scold me about it, Aemond!” Levana responded as Vermithor flew faster. The Gold King groaned as Vhagar followed after the Bronze Fury who landed just a few meters away from Dragonstone Castle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana was quick to unmount from her dragon, stroking his neck as she waited for her husband to unmount from his own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We left the children in the dead of night,” Aemond huffed, “no one knows where we are.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vad and Anam do,” Levana said, “they’re always watching us when we’re at the Dragonpit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond approached wife and wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her closer to him as they walked towards the castle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the civil war, Dragonstone Castle was bleak and nearly lifeless. There were plans to scout the area but no one fully entered the castle for fear of an ambush by those who are loyal to the Black Queen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Prince Sorin has, since then, made sure that there were no more loyalists to the Black Queen after. Levana asked they not be killed as a show of amity, but the Martell had other plans - he wasn’t going to let anyone go past him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will scout the Outer Bailey,” Aemond stated, “where shall I find you, Eva?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Great Hall,” Levana responded, “if I were Aegon, that would be an obvious hiding place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chuckled as he looked at his wife to make sure that her sword was on her before nodding, “shout for me and I will come.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen nodded, “if you find Cole, do not engage.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am more than capable of handling Criston Cole,” Aemond said confidently, “he no longer intimidates me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not it, Aemond,” Levana glared, “you know what I mean.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond pressed a kiss against Levana’s forehead, “I know, my love, I know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the two separated ways. Aemond stayed outside while Levana took a torch from the walls and began to make her way inside the castle. The halls of Dragonstone looked so different now compared to when she was much younger. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The walls were lifeless and the halls were silent - so much so that you can hear a pin drop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Levana continued deeper into the castle, she couldn’t help but think that her mind was playing tricks on her. She saw the phantom figures of her younger brothers - Jacaerys and Lucerys - walking in the halls and inside some chambers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She yearned for the brothers that she lost. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t help that Levana had to be the one to bury her brother and </span>
<em>
<span>mother</span>
</em>
<span>. Despite protests from her inner council, the Gold Queen was determined to give her birth mother a proper Targaryen burial. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lost in her thoughts as she walked through Dragonstone Castle, the memory of that recent event came rushing to her - she remembered it so vividly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana sat inside King Viserys’ chambers, a trunk of clothing sat in front of her as she looked through its contents. It was dawn now and the Gold Queen couldn’t get a wink of sleep as she prepared to bury her younger brother, Jacaerys and Queen Rhaenyra. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Beloved?” Laenor called as he opened the doors to the chambers, a somber expression on his face as he looked at Levana, “what are you doing?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I asked the servants to look for Queen Aemma’s clothes,” Levana said, “I didn’t want Queen Rhaenyra to be buried in the clothes that she died in.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You’re too kind.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“She’s my mother and despite all that has happened, I love her,” Levana said as she began to cry, “she will always be my mother.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Laenor walked towards his daughter, placing a hand on her shoulder as Levana leaned towards him. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“She wasn’t a perfect mother and I wasn’t a perfect daughter,” Levana said as she held a dress close to her chest; it was a dress that Laenor recognized to be the same one that Rhaenyra had worn when she gave birth to Joffrey. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I see her in my dreams,” Levana revealed, “in my dreams, she always apologized profusely to me and kept on saying that I was everything that she wanted as a daughter.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Laenor took a deep breath as he placed a hand on Levana’s head, stroking her hair. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I like to believe my dreams,” the Gold Queen said, “because they’re the only things I have of the ones I loved.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Ana,” Laenor knelt in front of his daughter, “you did what you had to do.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana smiled slightly, “that doesn’t change a thing.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m certain that your mother would have preferred to see you on the Iron Throne than Aegon,” Laenor said, “you are still carrying her blood on the throne.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The Gold Queen sighed as she stood up from the chair. She held the dress delicately in her arms as she made her way out of the room. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Are the bodies ready?” Levana asked as she made her way to the Red Keep’s Sept. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The Silent Sisters have prepared them for the burial,” Laenor said, “but are you sure you want to do this?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana nodded, “I’ve made my decision and such is final.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ser Nandor waited for them by the door of the Sept and bowed her head as the Queen walked inside the room. The Silent Sisters moved towards the side of the room as Levana approached Queen Rhaenyra’s body. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The Silent Sisters made work of the head; it was cleanly attached to the body now, but you can still see the wound where the Conqueror’s Sword made its cut. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Mother,” Levana called, “look, do you remember this dress?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Laenor approached Levana with a pair of scissors in hand as the Queen held the dress up. The Velaryon Lord began to cut through the back of the dress, making sure to avoid some embellishments. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Move, Ana,” Laenor said, but the Queen shook her head. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Levana placed the dress on top of her mother’s body and slowly began to dress her. Tears fell from her eyes as she brushed a strand of hair away from Rhaenyra’s face. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I love you, mother,” Levana whispered as she placed a kiss on Rhaenyra’s forehead before turning over to Jacaerys and doing the same thing. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Do not bandage their bodies,” Levana instructed, “they are to be buried this way.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>With that, the Queen walked out of the room to prepare herself. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The burial ceremony took place just outside the Red Keep. Two pyres were created for the bodies of Queen Rhaenyra and Prince Jacaerys. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Those in attendance were the Queen’s Small Council, the Lords and Ladies of her Sworn Houses and, of course, their family. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Where are Vermithor and Vhagar?” Laenor asked as she approached Levana who shook her head as she pointed towards the sky. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Syrax and Vermax landing from the sky. Rhaenyra guided Syrax towards Princess Rhaenyra’s pyre while Rhaena guided the other dragon to Jacaerys' pyre. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>With a heavy heart, Levana walked in between the pyres to face the crowd. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“We gather here today at the Seat of the Targaryen Dynasty to commit Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Prince Jacaerys Velaryon to the pyre,”</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> Levana took a deep breath as Aegon and Viserys talked to her side. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“As they burn towards the eternal flame, they leave us, their family and friends on land,” </em>
</b>
<em>
<span>Levana continued as she nodded at Rhaena and her grandmother, who did the same. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>“We will be forever bound by blood as ours runs thick and true,” </em>
</b>
<em>
<span>the Gold Queen took a deep breath as she faced the pyres. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>For a moment, there was silence as the Gold Queen gathered her thoughts. She looked at her mother and brother one last time before taking a deep breath, </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>“from ashes we rise and to ashes, we return.” </em>
</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rhaena and Rhaenys took a step back as Levana looked at the two dragons, who bellowed mournfully. She could see it in the eyes of Syrax and Vermax that they mourned for their riders - the ones whom they have bonded with.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>With a final breath, Levana wiped the tears from her eyes. </span>
</em>
</p><p>

<em>“Dracarys.” </em>

<p>
<span>Levana’s thoughts were interrupted the moment that she heard the crackling of fire in the Great Hall. She unsheathed the Conqueror’s Sword as she pushed the door open with her other hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a feeling of dread in the room that only became worse the moment that she saw Aegon seated on a chair by the fire. Levana looked around to ensure that no one, particularly Cole, was there to ambush her before she approached.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was beginning to think that you weren’t going to come, Eva,” Aegon coughed weakly, “this is a pleasant surprise.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Cole?” Levana asked as the male cackled, “he’s as good as dead.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is he, Aegon?” Levana repeated, “I’m not going to ask again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure that he’s dead,” Aegon responded, “heck, if there were any more dragons on this island, he would’ve been eaten already.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He abandoned you?” Levana raised a brow as Aegon turned to her. He was, for the lack of a better term, as good as dead at this point. He was no longer the same handsome young man that the Gold Queen had come to know - he was almost unrecognizable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>By now, his wounds had gotten too great that it rendered him crippled. His face had turned into something that Levana thought was a face that you would only see in nightmares. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since you’re there, I take it that you’re the Queen now,” Aegon said, “what happened to Rhaenyra?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dead.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who killed her?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the next question, Aegon?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The male laughed, “where’s Aemond?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s scouting the area,” Levana responded, “he should be coming soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Aegon sighed, “I’m ready, Ana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana raised a brow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can kill me now,” Aegon chuckled, “do you need a sign?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The maesters can still help you,” Levana said, “I’m sure Lady Alicent would want to see you again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck that,” Aegon responded, “she doesn’t have to pretend anymore and so does Helaena.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen took a deep breath as she walked closer to Aegon, “I can help you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want it,” Aegon hissed, “I don’t want nor need your mercy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re family,” Levana reminded, “you have children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t deserve them,” the Targaryen male stated, “I don’t deserve Helaena and I sure as the Seven Hells don’t deserve your mercy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not about that,” Levana said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Regardless, Eva,” Aegon coughed again, “I see Rhaenyra’s ghost sometimes, and she’s beckoning me to come with her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come with me, Aegon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then what?” Aegon laughed, “allow my mother to witness by demise and suffering?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The maesters can help you,” Levana urged, </span>
<b>“I can help you.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck that, Levana,” the male heaved, “just get it over with, you already have my sword.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause as Levana set the torch aside to hold the sword with both her hands. Aegon smiled and turned to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I loved you, Levana," Aegon revealed, "I always have." </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen paused as Aegon looked at her with a somber expression, "I had to live with the fact that you were never going to be mine and that's why I did everything I could to protect you when I took the throne." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Aegon," Levana took a deep breath, "what is this?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"All my life, I lived in envy of Aemond because he married the woman that I truly desired and loved," Aegon said, "the day that you got married was the day that I died." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana kept silent as Aegon turned his attention back to the flames. Her heart dropped at his confession, this was the first that she's ever heard of it - no one spoke about Aegon's feelings towards her and she just always thought of him as a brother; something that she thought he also thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"My heart couldn't bear your vows to my brother as I lived dreaming that you should have been saying those to me," Aegon laughed, "it seems that my brother has won in this lifetime." </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Targaryen male just laughed as loudly as he could before turning to Levana again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Not only does he ride the largest dragon in the world but he's to be king to the Queen that I wanted and the Queen that should have been mine," Aegon smiled, "looking at you now, I couldn't think of a better way to die." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"Aegon..." </span>
</p><p>
<b>"At the very least, you would be the last that I would see,"</b>
<span> Aegon said in melancholy, </span>
<b>"my last memory of this life would be the woman that I loved." </b>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon nodded at the Gold Queen, who held back tears as she raised her sword. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"When I reunite with my father," Aegon said, "I will tell him that he chose the right heir and Queen." </span>
</p><p>
<span>"We don't have to do this, Aegon," Levana urged, "I can take you back to the Red Keep." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon shook his head, "you have to do it now." </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen turned her head away and raised her sword as Aegon spoke, “maybe in our next lifetime, the gods would bless me and allow me to be yours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You would have to fight Aemond for that,” Levana muttered, “he’d never allow it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon chuckled again, “good bye, Queen Levana.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that the Gold Queen brought her sword down, plunging it into Aegon’s chest. She didn’t know when but she had begun to cry as life left Aegon’s body. The color of his cheeks quickly drained until he was no more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Levana pulled her sword away, Aemond ran into the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is he dead?” Aemond asked as Levana sheathed her sword and nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw Cole’s corpse,” Aemond revealed, “he hung himself by the dungeon tower.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana kept silent as she began to walk away from her husband, “we’ll send for people in the morning.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was Aegon dead when you arrived?” Aemond asked as Levana nodded simply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you find Cole’s corpse?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It looks fresh,” Aemond responded, “he probably just hung himself today.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen hummed, “he most likely killed Aegon first before hanging himself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He knew he’d be punished for it,” Aemond said as the two made their way back to the courtyard where Vermithor and Vhagar waited for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond watched as his wife mounted her dragon, stroking the Bronze Fury’s scales as he mounted his own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aegon loved you,” Aemond revealed, “he never spoke of it to anyone else.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana just chuckled, “wouldn’t that be the story?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the Gold Queen instructed her dragon to fly; Aemond did the same. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana remained quiet for the duration of their journey back to King’s Landing. In the back of her head, she just hoped that Aegon would be the last of her family that she had to bury. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>It was only a few days away from her coronation as Queen when Levana found herself in the shores of Driftmark - just a stone’s throw away from High Tide. She sat by the shore with her knees to her chest while Vermithor laid down in the distance; observing his rider. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked at the ocean with a somber expression. Now that the realm was finally calming down and everything was nearly in order, she had the time to think about what transpired in the past. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There were so many things in Levana’s head - all of which were about her family. Her sleepless nights are often filled with countless “what ifs”. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What if Aemond died in their fight with Daemon?</span>
</p><p>
<span>What if Daemon survived and succeeded in taking Harrenhal?</span>
</p><p>
<span>What if Rhaenyra accepted her offer of salvation?</span>
</p><p>
<span>What if Aegon believed in her mercy?</span>
</p><p>
<span>What if she was the one who died? </span>
</p><p>
<span>These thoughts often kept her busy to the point where even her sons would start to worry about her. Aegon and Viserys often kept their </span>
<em>
<span>mother </span>
</em>
<span>company whenever she was in the library, and they would often be the first to report to their </span>
<em>
<span>father </span>
</em>
<span>if they felt their mother needed sleep or rest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana would refuse, of course, but relented whenever her husband would get involved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was a rare day as Levana managed to escape from her advisors, council, children, and husband to be alone. She felt as though the silence and the sound of the waves would allow her to think and calm herself before the coronation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the side of her eye, she saw someone sit beside her - a wave of blue. A figure that she knew all too well. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Do you regret this?” </span>
</em>
<span>The voice of Rhaenyra sent chills through Levana’s spine; so much so that she pulled her knees closer to her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no regrets,” Levana stated, “what happened needed to happen.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I would never second guess that,” </span>
</em>
<span>the Black Queen laughed, </span>
<em>
<span>“you are too stubborn for your own good.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“This war turned me into who I needed to be,” Levana sighed deeply, “any regrets that I might have had in the past don’t matter now.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Do you know my deepest regret?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” the Gold Queen responded</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I could never see you become Queen.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled slightly, “you wanted Jacaerys to be king.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Who said so?” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra asked, </span>
<em>
<span>“you were always destined to lead.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why leave Jacaerys without a title?” Levana asked, “why would Lucerys become Lord of the Tides if he had an older brother?” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Because I had the impression that Jacaerys would be your Hand,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra responded, </span>
<em>
<span>“he is closest to you and a smart boy, as I have come to discover.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana just kept silent as the figure moved closer to her. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I never wanted to hurt you, Ana,” </span>
</em>
<span>Rhaenyra said, </span>
<em>
<span>“I was too selfish for my own good that I allowed Daemon to manipulate me.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled, “he tried to manipulate his son too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long pause as the figure stood up, </span>
<em>
<span>“I love you, Ana, I want you to know that you will always be the best of me.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled lightly as the figure disappeared. She turned toward where the figure once stood before smiling to herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do have a regret,” the Queen sighed deeply, “it was that I didn’t call you mother one last time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The wind blew as Levana stood. From afar, she would see two dragons approaching the shore; Vermithor lifted his head to watch the dragons as they approached, bellowing as Syrax and Moon Dancer came into view. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two smaller dragons landed a few meters away from Vermithor, who grunted and returned to his resting position. Princesses Rhaenys and Baela unmounted from their dragons and walked towards Levana, who greeted them with a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond thought that you would be here,” Rhaenys stated, “as the King is presently occupied with matters concerning the realm, we’ve come to check on the Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Viserys mentioned that you left just after breakfast and haven’t returned since,” Baela said worriedly, “what’s on your mind, sister?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Many things,” Levana sighed, “I thought coming to my childhood home would be beneficial to clear my head.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The three women looked towards the ocean - each with a somber expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you miss Driftmark?” Rhaenys asked as Levana nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed the time when things were much simpler,” Levana sighed, “when I was much younger and my mother was the woman who I needed her to be.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause before Levana turned to her grandmother. </span>
</p><p>
<b>“When my family was complete.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys wrapped an arm around Levana’s shoulders and pulled her close, “Jace and Luke would be so proud to see you ascend the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My world crumbled the day that I had to send Luke to the pyre,” Levana said, “I knew from that day that I was a different person and many things would be different.” </span>
</p><p>
<b>“You’re like a dragon, Ana,”</b>
<span> Baela said, </span>
<b>“you rose from the ashes.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen smiled slightly, “I wonder sometimes if King Viserys would be proud of what I’ve done to secure the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Rhaenys sighed, “he would be proud to have you as his successor after everything that you’ve done.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But were they the right thing, grandmother?” Levana asked, “did I really do everything right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t do anything that didn’t seem wrong,” Baela interjected, “what you did was what needed to happen while it did.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for feeding my ego, Baela,” Levana chuckled, “I would like to believe in that as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“By the by,” Rhaenys looked at Levana, “the maesters informed me of something unusual.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it, grandmother?” Levana asked as she stepped away from her Hand who smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The maesters made mention of certain similarities in features of Daemon and little Rhaenys,” The Queen’s Hand cleared her throat, “I told them not to worry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana’s heart clenched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do not mention to Aemond what you have just told me,” Levana said, “he doesn’t need to know about this.” </span>
</p>

<p>
<span>As Levana and Aemond’s formal coronation draws near, the capital is as busy as ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Each member of the Queen’s Small Council was assigned an area to be in-charge of throughout the festivities. Princess Rhaenys, the Queen’s Hand, was the overseer of all that was related to the coronation. Lord Laenor, on the other hand, made it so that all the Houses of the realm were present at the event to swear their fielty to the new Queen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One thing that Levana always did differently from her predecessors was to give the Houses the freedom to decide whether they would swear to her or not. This was a law that the Queen would make absolute - the freedom of choice must always be honored. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Remarkably, all the Houses swore to the Gold Queen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Small Council anticipated that a very few would rather remain loyal to whoever they swore but all decided to swear under the helm of the Golds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond and Levana sat in the Small Council chamber. A meeting had just ended and the two found it the ideal place to discuss plans after the coronation where they would, at the very least, be away from prying ears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queensguard stayed outside the chamber, guarding the door from anyone who wished to disturb the peace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Graces,” Ser Harrold called from the door, “someone wishes to speak to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is it?” Aemond asked, an annoyed expression rested on his face as the knight cleared his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s I.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana and Aemond turned to each other with a puzzled look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enter, Lady Alicent,” Levana said as the doors open to reveal Lady Alicent with a small smile on her face. The doors were quick to close as they opened while Lady Alicent made her way towards the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen examined her and furrowed her brows. She was not wearing the usual Hightower Green, instead, she wore a simple black frock. Immediately, Levana knew that there was something wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What bothers you, Lady Alicent?” Levana asked, “has something happpened?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have just come to see my children,” Alicent smiled weakly, “and I’ve come with a request that I hope the Queen would consider.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything,” Levana said as Alicent took a deep breath and turned to Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would like to be tried, Queen Levana,” Alicent said, “I would, no doubt, be proclaimed guilty for all that I’ve done against my House.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The request took the Queen and King by surprise. Aemond turned to his mother and shook his head, “mother, you do know what the penalty would be?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent nodded, “and I am ready for my death.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent,” Levana began, “surely you don’t mean this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” Alicent smiled, “your reign cannot move forward as long as I am here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana and Aemond stayed silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will confess all that I have done to the Lord Confessor,” Alicent said, “then I will give myself to the mercy of the Queen’s Justice.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please reconsider,” Aemond finally spoke, “no one wishes for your death, mother.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish for it,” Alicent responded, “I am plagued with all that I’ve done in the past and the only way that I can redeem myself is through death.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our coronation is in three day’s time,” Levana reminded, “we can consider your request after that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It needs to happen before your coronation,” Alicent said, “otherwise, I believe that your reign won’t be as fortunate.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause as Levana looked at Lady Alicent with a sad expression. She cleared her throat as she looked at her husband who nodded in response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ser Harrold,” Levana called as the Lord Commander of the Queensguard entered the chambers with Ser Nandor in tow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Summon my Small Council,” the Gold Queen instructed, “there is a matter that we urgently need to discuss.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Immediately, Your Grace,” Ser Nandor bowed his head but Levana called him back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you, you are the Queen’s Justice,” Levana said as the knight nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent, Ser Qarl will escort you to your chambers as we discuss your request with the Small Council.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent smiled before walking towards Aemond and placing a kiss on his cheek. She did the same with Levana before following Ser Qarl out of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be frank with me, husband,” Levana turned to Aemond as the doors closed once more, “what say you about your mother’s request?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it absurd,” Aemond responded, “why would she ask for death?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana took a deep breath as she stood up and walked towards the balcony behind her seat. She stood in silence as she looked at King’s Landing from afar. Whatever was destroyed during the civil war was getting rebuilt and the Dragonpit was also getting reinforced to accommodate dragons from House Targaryen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva,” Aemond walked towards his wife, “you aren’t thinking about granting her request, are you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen took a deep breath before turning to her husband, </span>
<b>“this was her choice.” </b>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva, please be reasonable.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am being reasonable, Aemond,” Levana said, “she has made her decision and regardless of what we think, we need to respect that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond pursed his lips, “will you make the decision?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana shook her head, “Lady Alicent was specific that she wanted to be handed to the Lord Confessor and I trust that Airell will have fair judgement.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Targaryen was looked down and as he was about to say something, the doors opened to reveal Ser Harrold with the Small Council in tow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something the matter, Your Grace?” Galatea asked as Levana gestured for them to take their respective seats around the table. Aemond took a seat behind Levana’s and observed the Small Council who looked at the Queen with a puzzled expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent has come to the King and I with a request,” Levana took a deep breath, “she requests to be tried for her crimes against House Targaryen and the realm.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Airell raised a brow, “why would she ask for that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent mentioned that the Queen’s reign would be unfortunate if she were to stay,” Aemond said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Galatea’s brows burrowed, “I believe that’s why she has been consulting with the maesters for the past few days.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What have you heard?” Laenor asked, “what did the Maesters say?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I consulted with Grand Maester Priamos and according to him, the Lady Alicent came to them to ask if there anything that she would contribute to the Gold Queen’s reign,” Galatea began, “one of the Maesters advised that as long as someone from the past is present, Queen Levana’s reign would crumble.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What say you, Your Grace?” Sorin asked, “how do we approach the situation?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent has made her mind,” Levana said firmly, “she is to give herself for judgement to the Lord Confessor and then to the Queen’s Justice.” </span>
</p>
</div>

<div class="meta group">
<h2 class="heading">【𝟏𝟏𝟐】</h2>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>At the request of Lady Alicent, her trial took place in front of the Dragonpit. In her defense, the location was ideal as it was a symbol of House Targaryen and fitting for Levana with her moniker of Mother of Dragons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was also where their coronation would be held. Lady Alicent stated if there was any blood of hers that would be spilled, it would be a way to protect House Targaryen to build a sturdier foundation of the house as it would be reborn with the blood of an usurper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana along with Aemond and her Small Council sat on top a makeshift stage just in front of the gates of the Dragonpit as Lady Alicent’s carriage, escorted by the City Watch, arrived. From the carriage emerged the Hightower dressed in a simple black garb; her hair remained untied as she made her way towards the Queen. Despite the instance, she held her head high with a smile on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent Hightower,” Airell began, “you stand accused of murder and treason." </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a short pause as the Lord Confessor looked towards her, "how do you answer these charges?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I plead guilty," Alicent began, "I murdered King Viserys Targaryen by giving him small doses of Tears of Lys until his health declined and he died." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Gasps came from the crowd as Airell looked down, "and treason?" </span>
</p><p>
<span>"I conspired with Otto Hightower, Criston Cole, and the rest of Aegon Targaryen's Small Council to usurp the throne from its rightful heir, Queen Levana Velaryon and her mother, Rhaenyra Targaryen." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond held his wife's hand as he watched. While their relationship had turned sour, the Targaryen King cared deeply for this mother - she never abandoned him and the fact that he just had to sit by and watch the trial left a bitter taste in his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"There is another crime that I wish to confess to," Alicent turned to Levana and Aemond with a small smile, "I committed a crime of infidelity against King Viserys Targaryen by bedding his brother, Prince Daemon." </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana held her husband's hand tightly as Airell stood up from her seat. Ser Nandor then walked towards Alicent who took her place behind the beheading stone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lady Alicent Hightower, you are charged guilty for your crimes against House Targaryen and your crimes are therfor punishable by death,” Airell said as Ser Nandor nodded in response. He unsheathed his sword and raised it, preparing to strike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alicent, for the last time, turned to Levana and Aemond with a smile on her face, “I love you both,” she whispered as the blade swiftly cut through woman’s neck - ending her life. Lady Alicent’s head fell on the basket just below the beheading stone as blood poured from her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long period of silence that enveloped King’s Landing as the skies darkened. Rain began to fall as Levana hung her head low; tears were falling from her eyes as the Small Council quickly began to make their way to the carriages. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Ladies of the Court began to collect Lady Alicent’s body as the rain poured harder. Levana, on the other hand, remained seated. Aemond had to pull her away from the chair and push her into a carriage to get her out of the rain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long silence between the two of them as their carriage made its way back to the Red Keep. Aemond watched his wife who was starting at her lap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is my greatest hope that we wouldn’t need to do this again,” Levana whispered, “we’ve lost so many family members already.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to lose anyone else,” the Gold Queen continued, “I’ve nearly lost all my brothers, my mothers, my grandsire, and my children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond took a deep breath as he pulled his wife into an embrace. The Velaryon sobbed into his chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought that this war had made me so strong,” Levana said, “but it seems as though we all have a breaking point.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond chuckled slightly as he placed a hand on her head, stroking her hair. More than anything he knew that words wasn’t what his wife needed now - but there was something that he couldn’t help but ask.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long have you known?” Aemond asked, “about my </span>
<em>
<span>real </span>
</em>
<span>father?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A long time,” Levana confessed, “the day that you found out was the day that I did as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you…?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aemond,” she sighed, “I think most of you forget that I have an impeccable sense of hearing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who else knows?” Aemond asked, “Eva, why…?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Myself and my grandmother,” Levana confessed, “no one else knows and no one else will.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you sure of that?” Aemond asked, “with my mother’s confession, there will surely be doubts.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Doubts that will not befall this house,” Levana said, “Sorin and Airell will see to it that no one will question your birth father.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond did not doubt his wife but doubt and shame filled his heart. He frowned as he looked away from his wife, sighing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This does not affect how I see you, Aemond,” Levana placed a hand on his cheek, “regardless of who you father is, it does not change what I feel about you and how I see you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daemon killed our children.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are </span>
<b>not </b>
<span>Daemon,” Levana said firmly, “you might be his son but you are not him and his crimes will not be yours, Aemond.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, does it?” Aemond chuckled, “now I know where my ruthlessness came from.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana wrapped her arms around him, “I said it once and I will say it again, I will not lose you to Daemon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva,” the Targaryen King sighed, “we cannot live in a lie forever.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will not have live your life the </span>
<em>
<span>bastard king</span>
</em>
<span>,” the Velaryon Queen responded, “if this is something that I must take to the grave, then I will.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the last time that I will hear of this, Aemond,” Levana placed a kiss on his cheek as the carriages came to a halt, “our coronation is tomorrow.” </span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<span>Dusk fell upon the Red Keep and the preparations for the coronation are at its peak. Laenor and Rhaenys took it upon themselves to make sure that everything would go smoothly and without a hitch. Aemond, on the other hand, spent the morning with his children, reading to them at the Godswood before he was summoned by Lord Corlys to prepare him for the coronation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was nearly time for them to proceed to the Dragonpit when Galatea assembled the Small Council and the King. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is so urgent that I was pulled out of my chambers?” Sorin crossed his arms, “has something happened?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Queen is missing,” Galatea said, “we’ve searched everywhere in the castle and the City Watch is making rounds around the city.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, isn’t this just quaint?” Airell chuckled, taking a sip from her goblet, “who saw her last?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t seen Levana since last night,” Rhaenys said, “maybe the King knows?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I woke up and she wasn’t in our bed,” Aemond responded, “I thought that she would be with the children but the nurses denied seeing her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t have a coronation without the Queen!” Laenor raised his voice, “maybe she went for a dragon ride?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the Small Council scrambled to think of a way to find the Queen, a knock came upon the Council Chambers and the door opened to reveal Helaena with the young Princess Rhaenys in her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If it is Eva that you’re looking for, she’s in Dragonstone,” Helaena said, “she said she wanted to visit before she was crowned.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll go,” Rhaenys volunteered as she began to make her way out of the chambers only to be stopped by Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will,” Aemond placed a hand on her shoulder, “we still have time before the coronation and I’ll make sure that she’s back before then.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace--” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I insist, Lady Hand,” Aemond smiled slightly as he made his way out of the Council Chambers and to the Dragonpit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>━━━━ ◦ ❖ ◦━━━━</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Levana stood in the Great Hall of Dragonstone clad in her coronation dress - a blend of gold, black, and red adorning the garment as she admired the Painted Table that her mother used in the war. From the corner of her eye, she could see phantom figures running around the room; she could hear the very faint voices of her younger brothers - Jacaerys and Lucerys as she smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You mustn’t lurk in doorways, King Aemond,” Levana turned to see her husband by the door, “it’s rude.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I’d find you here,” Aemond chuckled as he walked down the steps of the Great Hall, “what are you doing here, Your Grace?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen walked towards him, taking his hands in hers as she gazed upon his face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just wanted to visit,” Levana sighed, “I figured that this would be the place where I’d feel the presence of my brothers the most and it just felt wrong to not visit on such a momentous day.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“After the coronation,” Aemond began, “we should sent for people here to fix the castle.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded, “I would like that very much,” she looked around her and took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d hate to interrupt, my love, but your Small Council is growing restless by the second,” Aemond offered his arm to his wife who gladly took it. The two made their way out of the castle to be greeted by their dragons by the shore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll be back, Eva,” Aemond promised, “I recall making a promise to my wife that we would marry again on Dragonstone and I intend to make good on that promise.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled, “I hope that you do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Targaryen male nodded as he mounted Vhagar. Levana, on the other hand, stood beside Vermithor as she took one last look at Dragonstone - spotting the phantom figure of her mother in one of the towers. She smiled and waved at the figure before mounting her dragon and turning to Aemond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told them to begin the procession,” Aemond said, “we shall proceed to the Dragonpit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded as Vermithor took off; Vhagar following shortly after. They flew over Kings Landing, watching the smallfolk pile in front of the Dragonpit. They could hear the cheers of the crowd as the two made their way to the pits where the Small Council waited for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never do that again,” Laenor crossed his arms as Levana unmounted from Vermithor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father,” Levana chuckled and placed a kiss on his cheek, “I just wanted to visit my childhood home and say goodbye to the ghosts that dwell in it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure the visit could’ve waited,” Laenor responded with a chuckle as Lord Corlys approached them with the Queensguard in tow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gold suits you, Ser Harrold,” Levana commented as her oldest friend chuckled a response. Ser Harrold wore golden armor and a red cape - it puzzled Levana but she waited for a possible explanation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You flatter me, Your Grace,” Ser Harrold bowed his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Humor me, Ser Harrold,” Levana said, “the Lord Commander is supposed to wear a black cape.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” Ser Harrold nodded his head, “Your Grace, I hope it pleases you that I will be relenting my duties as Lord Commander to Ser Nandor Vaith.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As if on cue, Ser Nandor approached them - he wore the cape intended for the Lord Commander. Levana turned to him with a surprised expression before gazing back at Ser Harrold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will still serve you, My Queen, to my last breath,” Ser Harrold bowed his head, “but I believe that Ser Nandor is best fit to stand as your Lord Commander given that he served you as Queen the longest.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned Ser Nandor with a smile, “it would be an honor for me to have you as my Lord Commander, Ser Nandor.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Your Grace, it is mine,” Ser Nandor responded as Lord Corlys cleared his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s time,” Corlys said, “the crowd has assembled and they eagerly await their King and Queen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Small Council bid their farewells to Levana and Aemond who remained by their dragons. Levana leaned her forehead against Vermithor’s snout, </span>
<em>
<span>“thank you, old friend.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vermithor bellowed as Vhagar leaned her head down, allowing Levana to stroke her snout. Aemond joined them, placing a hand on Vhagar’s snout as well before taking his wife’s hand in his. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall we?” Aemond asked as Levana nodded and the two made their way to the dome just above the reconstructed Dragonpit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana remained in one of the tunnels, waiting for her ceremonious entrance to be announced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Hand of the Queen, Princess Rhaenys stood on the stage to face the crowd as she addressed them: </span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>People of King's Landing, today history will be made.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>Never has the House of the Dragon seen a Queen to rule the realm but today, that is about to change. </b>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd cheered and clapped in excitement - a response that she never would have expected from them but it was a welcome change nonetheless.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>With the end of the Targaryen Civil War, we are finally able to crown the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and the successor of King Viserys the Peaceful. </b>
</p><p>
<span>The crowds cheers slowly started to become louder but they were drowned by the thumping of Levana’s heart. She tried to drown out as much nose as she could as a figure approached her from behind, placing a hand on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m proud of you,” </span>
</em>
<span>the figure whispered as Levana turned her head slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, mother,” she whispered as she turned her attention back to the stage. Where Princess Rhaenys stood with Joffrey beside her - Aemond’s crown on a cushion in the young prince’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Today, we crown King Aemond Targaryen,” Rhaenys announced as Aemond stepped towards the center of the stage with Lord Laenor in tow. Joffrey walked beside his father as Aemond knelt in front of him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“People of King’s Landing,” Laenor began, “I present to you, King Aemond Targaryen, the King Consort,” he announced as he placed a crown on Aemond’s head. The crowd cheered as Aemond stood up, bowing his head slightly at Lord Laenor who proceeded to present him with Dark Sister. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded and took Dark Sister in his hands before taking a step aside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Lord Harrold stood beside the Queen, “it’s time, Your Grace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana nodded and looked up at him, “thank you, Ser Harrold, for being my protector.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your Grace,” Ser Harrold smiled, “I would protect you in this lifetime and in the next if you would allow it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, the soldiers of the Queensguard and the City Watch began to march forward, creating a pathway for the Queen. Levana took a deep breath before turning towards the darkness of the tunnel where a figure of her mother stood.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I will always be with you.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Trumpets began to play as the knights held their swords up in reverence to Levana whobegan to make her way through the crowd. As she passed, they let their swords fall to their sides. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Levana reached the platform, a little girl made her way past the soldiers, stopping the Queen in her tracks. The knights were about to escort the child away when Levana held up her hand and knelt in front of the girl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember you,” Levana said as the little girl nodded and presented the Queen with a string of flowers. It was the same flowers that she presented to the Queen the day that the Golds took Kings Landing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is my honor to see you again, My Queen,” the little girl spoke as she placed the string of flowers around Levana’s neck before walking back into the crowd. The Queen smiled as she stood up and continued to make her way to the stage. The knights holding their swords to their chests as she took her place in front of Princess Rhaenys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Lady Hand continued to speak: </span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>It is our great good fortune and privilege to present the Queen to you on this day.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>A new day for our city, a new day for our realms, and a new king to lead us. </b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana knelt in front of them as the High Septon walked towards her. He took oil in his hands as he began to say: </span>
</p><p align="center">
<em>
<span>May the Warrior give her courage. May the Smith lend strength to her sword and shield. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Grand Septon began to anoint Levana with oil as he continued: </span>
</p><p align="center">
<em>
<span>May the Father defend her in her need. May the Crone lift her shining lamp and light her way to wisdom.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The High Septon handed the crown to Ser Nandor who took the Septon’s place. The new Lord Commander of the Queensguard held up the crown for all to see. </span>
</p><p>
<span>"The crown of the Gold Queen that will usher in a new realm," Ser Nandor placed the crown on Levana’s head as the Queen stood up. The roar of the crowd was now accompanied by the bellows of the dragons in the pit below.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lord Corlys approached Levana and placed the Conqueror’s Sword in her hand as the Queen made her way to the center of the stage. Princess Rhaenys taking her place beside the Queen as she addressed the crowd: </span>
</p><p align="center">
<b>All Hail Her Grace, Queen Levana Velaryon of House Targaryen, the First and Last of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men; Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, The Gold Queen, Patron of the Iron Islands, the Free Cities, and Dorne; the Protector of the Realm and the Mother of Dragons.</b>
</p><p align="center">
<b>Levana the Queen! </b>
</p><p>
<span>Levana looked towards her people with a proud smile. She raised Blackfyre as the crowd and the dragons cheered. The crowd chanted her name, throwing flowers everywhere as the dragons continued to roar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Looking at her people and then at her family, she spotted a figure vaguely resembling King Visersys standing beside her younger brother with a smile on his face, with him was a figure of a younger Levana, cheering along with the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana closed her eyes as the cheers of the crowd became more distant and she found herself back in the Red Keep. She recognized this to be one of her many visions. She approached two figures that she recognized as her Grandsire and Grandmother.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Queen Aemma looked at her husband with a small smile, "shall I tell you of a dream that I've had about a babe?" </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>King Viserys smiled in amusement, "a dream, you say?" He asked as his Queen nodded, "I would love to hear it." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The Queen smiled at him, "I dreamt of a large and bright moon," she began, "a large moon shining over the Iron Throne as a large dragon loomed behind it," she narrated as the King listened intently. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>"Then I would see the shadow of a person wearing a crown that I have not yet seen before," Queen Aemma continued, "and when this shadow raised a sword, dragons followed." </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Levana was brought back to the present when Aemond took her hand in his. The two sharing a kiss as the Harvest Moon slowly rose to the skies - ushering in a new era for House Targaryen and the realm. </span>

<p>
<span>A young princess - around the age of 12 -  with silver hair and lavender eyes stood in front of the Iron Throne, admiring it and the stained glass behind it depicting the Harvest Moon and Vermithor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Princess Rhaenys the Younger.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Queen Levana crossed her arms over her chest as her daughter turned to her with a sheepish smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother,” Rhaenys ran towards the Queen and wrapped her arms around her, “I know what you’re going to say.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana pursed her lips, “your brothers have informed me that you skipped your lessons with the Septa today, is it true?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys could only nod in response, “I went to ride Syrax with father and Uncle Joffrey.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for being truthful,” Levana chuckled, “how was your dragon ride?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We went to Dragonstone and back, mother!” Rhaenys said excitedly, “the castle is more lively now that there are people living there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana hummed, “shall we take a walk?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys nodded and held her mother’s hand as they walked out of the Great Hall. Servants greeted the two as they made their way through the hallowed halls of the Red Keep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it true that before I claimed Syrax, it once belonged to my grandmothers?” Rhaenys asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana turned to her and nodded, “yes, my dear, Syrax once belonged to my mother, Princess Rhaenyra, and then to my grandmother, your namesake.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I could have met Princess Rhaenys,” the young princess sighed as her mother chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did when you were a babe,” Levana said, “she was there when I gave birth to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys pursed her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was there when I gave you your name,” Levana continued, “and she was there when you had your first steps.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Rhaenys was about to speak, Ser Nandor, still at his post as Lord Commander of the Queensguard, approached them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My Queen,” Ser Nandor bowed his head before turning to Rhaenys, “My Princess.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it, old friend?” Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Lord of the Tides has arrived,” Ser Nandor announced, “he is shortly due at the gates.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Ser Nandor,” Levana said as she turned to Rhaenys, “let’s collect your brothers and greet your Grandsire, shall we?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys nodded and the two excused themselves from the knight as they made their way to the library where Aemond was seated with Viserys and Aegon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your mother and I complained less when we were given books,” Aemond scolded as the two boys, no older than fifteen, hung their heads low. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come now, Aemond,” Levana chuckled, “is there really reason to be scolding our boys?” </span>
</p><p>
<span> “Eva,” Aemond smiled as he walked towards her, placing a kiss on her cheek before turning to his sons, “they refuse to cooperate with the Septon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And why is that, boys?” Levana asked as Rhaenys joined her brothers on the table, looking at the books that they were reading. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do we need to study this, mother?” Aegon asked, “we were alive when it happened!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if you were, I doubt you remember anything,” Levana said sternly, “you could barely form sentences when the Civil War happened, Aegon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father has told us stories!” Viserys said, “stories that are far more intriguing than what Lady Galatea wrote in the book!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana chuckled in amusement as she gestured towards the books, “children, these books that tell the tale of the Targaryen War and what happened after my legacy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aegon, Viserys, and Rhaenys turned to their parents with a curious gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is the legacy of our family,” Aemond said proudly, “what we have in these books are lessons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Valuable lessons that will hopefully ensure that history does not repeat itself,” Levana chuckled, “gods forbid that my children fight over the throne.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know I won’t!” Aegon said, “I’m much more content in being Rhaenys’ Hand!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I’m going to be her Lord Confessor,” Viserys chuckled as he turned to Rhaenys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to protect Rhaenys,” Aegon swore, “and we won’t let anything happen to her as long as we live!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana smiled, leaning her head against Aemond’s shoulder. The King chuckled as they watched their children gush over the books laid out on the tables. Since Levana took the throne, the realm has been peaceful - there were no unrests, wars, and battles; everything was settled with talks and compromise. The trade between Westeros and the Free Cities thrived and the realm was at its richest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Moments of peace such as this is what Levana had hoped for since she took the throne and, more than anything, she was glad that they were able to have these moments. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ana,” Joffrey approached them, he looked so much like a mixture of Jacaerys and Lucerys now that he was much older. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Joff?” Levana asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father has arrived with Rhaena,” Joffrey announced as the Queen nodded and turned to her children again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come now, children,” Levana said, “we must greet your Aunt and Grandsire.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rhaenys and her brothers quickly piled out of the library and made their way towards the Great Hall - laughing amongst each other as Joffrey followed after them. Levana and Aemond were left to bask in the echoes of their laughter as they walked towards the Hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you ever imagine that we would live in peace like this?” Aemond asked, “I surely didn’t.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t either,” Levana confessed, “but this was something that King Viserys believed in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wonder if they are all together in the afterlife,” Aemond chuckled, “our family.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope they are,” the Gold Queen mused, “at the very least, I hope Baelon and Aemma aren’t causing them too much trouble in the afterlife.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I miss them,” Aemond said, “our first children.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, they have blessed us with three,” Levana said, “and I think having Aegon and Viserys around makes everything much better, don’t you agree?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Aemond nodded, “it fills my heart with joy knowing that they are in full support of Rhaenys becoming Queen one day.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As it does mine,” Levana said as they arrived at the Great Hall. The King and Queen smiled at the knights who bowed their heads in acknowledgement as they opened the giant doors. </span>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p>
<span>Levana twitched, “I will never be used to that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you have this lifetime to do so,” Aemond chuckled as he led the Queen towards the Throne; passing  by members of their family as she did so. Levana took a seat on the Iron Throne, placing her hand on one of the rests before turning to address the members of her family</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Father,” Levana greeted as Lord Laenor, the Lord of the Tides, bowed his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It fills my heart with joy everytime I see you sit the throne, Ana,” Laenor smiled as the Queen did the same before turning to Rhaena. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sister, I’m glad that you could make it,” Levana said as Rhaena nodded a response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We wouldn’t miss your Name Day for the world, Ana,” Rhaena responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is Dragonstone?” Levana asked,</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is my honor to be the Keeper of our House’s seat while you are on the Iron Throne, Ana,” Rhaena said, “I will try my best to make sure that the island and its residents are well taken care of.” </span>

</p><p>
<b>Princess Baela Targaryen, the Hand of the Queen, and the Small Council. </b>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t this a lovely reunion,” Prince Sorin, the Master of Laws and Lord Justiciar, said with a grin on his face. </span>

<span>“It’s been some time since we last saw each other, Your Grace,” Lady Nesrin, the Master of Whisperers curtsied as the other members of the Small Council assembled by them; this included Lady Galatea (the Master of Coin and Lady Treasurer), Airell Drahar (the Lord Confessor), and King Besian (the Master of Ships and the Grand Admirall). They are also joined by Lord Cregan Stark, the appointed Keeper of the North. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It brings me great joy that my old friends and family have come to join me on such an important day,” Levana smiled as the small crowd cheered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We wouldn’t miss it for the world, Your Grace,” Cregan said as the others agreed in unison. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As much as I would love to stay here and chat with everyone, I do suppose that we should be heading to supper,” Levana said as she stood from the Iron Throne, “supper will be served in the Small Hall.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Upon the announcement of the Queen, everyone began to make their way towards the Small Hall - leaving Levana in the Throne Room upon her request. There, she stood in the middle of the room, marveling at the Iron Throne - the same way that she found Rhaenys earlier in the day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana closed her eyes, smiling to herself as she felt a presence stand beside her. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You’ve done well, Little Moon,” </span>
</em>
<span>the voice of King Viserys spoke, </span>
<em>
<span>“you’ve made me proud, that is certain.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Queen looked upon the Iron Throne again and in front of it stood a vision of Princess Rhaenyra - smiling widely and wearing the garments that Levana had sent her to the pyre in; she was adorned in Arryn Blue as she looked at Levana with the sweetest smile. Joining her were visions of Jacaerys and Lucerys as well as her two young children. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Levana could only chuckle as a tear fell down her cheek. She lifted the skirt of her dress, curtsying to the figures that were once part of her life before turning towards the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Gold Queen’s rule gave birth to a thriving realm and one that was without war - many loved her and many were not so opposed to having a Queen sit on the Iron Throne. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the legacy that Queen Levana Velaryon would leave in Westeros - she would be known as the Queen Who Saved the Realm and the Heir of te Song of Ice and Fire for centuries to come. </span>

<p>Thank you, everyone, for coming on this journey with me and Levana! It took a long while for us to bring it to Archive of Our Own because I wanted to finish this on the other platform first before I could bring it to this one! </p><p>
<span>I would like to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who supported QUERENCIA to this day. It makes me so happy and fills my heart with so much joy that there are still some of you who supported this book from the beginning through the end - more so that there are still people discovering this book for the first time. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for sticking around! I hope that Levana’s story is one to remember for you guys. </span>
</p><p>
<span>I started writing QUERENCIA in December 2022 with no plan at all - just the whim and the desire to start writing again. Prior to even starting this book, I took a very long hiatus from writing personal and passion pieces to give way to work as I am also a writer in my corporate life. I didn’t expect people to love this book, to love Levana, and to love the story in general - even if you didn’t, even if you dropped it midway, I am still thankful that you gave my book a chance. This was my passion project for a while and despite the inconsistencies in my updates in the latter part of 2023, I was so determined to finish this because this story means so much to me. House of the Dragon and this book allowed me to return to writing and it allowed me to fall in love with the craft all over again. That said, this book means much to me. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Will I write for House of the Dragon again? Yes, most definitely. A couple of months back (or maybe even a year ago), I hinted that I was working on a new House of the Dragon plot which I might explore once the new season airs. But until then, I will be publishing books for other fandoms - ones that I have been looking to explore for months now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That said, thank you, everyone, for sticking around and for seeing this through to the end with me. I appreciate all of you and I am thankful that, despite the long wait between updates, you guys still come back to the story. Rest assured that this won’t be my last dip into Westeros or in the House of the Dragon universe and I will strive to deliver another story as grand as this one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But, until then, thank you, everyone for being here and for supporting QUERENCIA and myself thus far! I hope to see ya’ll again soon! </span>
</p><p>
<span>With love, </span>
